  <data key="d1">i don't like taking meds, when i get like this i usually take a day or more off, i generally refer to it as a reset. depending on what your triggers are, sometimes you just need a big break from them. i have a high stress job, but luckily also have personal leave and can take it at a moments notice. if that's not something you can do, try even an hour away.</data>

  <data key="d1">i hate to say it but i've been on numerous ssris and i lost my libido and sensitivity down there on every one. i've never been on zoloft but i've heard it's the same. i'm currently on trintellix because it wasn't supposed to be as bad, and it wasn't for a year, but now it's as bad as ever. i don't know if i'd call it a good thing, but since i now have no interest in sex, the dysfunction part of it doesn't matter. i'm thinking of getting off the trintellix for that reason, but i'm undecided because it does really help</data>

  <data key="d1">you have to try to look at these coincidences in different ways. lets say during the summer i said the same thing about a tornado happening in my town. i mean its possible. i cant remember the last time we had one touch down here. but we get thunder storms every couple of weeks so you never know. coincidences happen to everyone and there is nothing you can do about them except laugh. once you learn that your brain is only noticing the stuff you get right youll be able to get through this. okay the tornado thing happened, but what about everything else you said that day, week, or month. i guarantee you had plenty of things you said that didnt happen. let me know if you have any questions. i was once in the same place that you are with coincidences.</data>

  <data key="d1">they have only gotten worse. i was thinking about getting signs for a specific first name and a separate specific last name. i was thinking of getting them together which is a bad thing for my narrative. they start with t and s. so this was one night and the very next day i literally see a glowing t and s in the clouds right next to each other. like glowing so much brighter than anything else in the sky except the sun. then where i was on my way to an empty house for sale there was a brand name object called the first name i was thinking thats literally the first name of the thing and it was sitting for some very bizarre reason on top of a water heater brand name the last name i was thinking. i actually havent really been able to calm down since this happened. i cant understand why things keep happening that fit this narrative of mine. the narrative is horrible and terrible and would change everything as i know it. so they can never ever be taken as good signs. i dont know how to understand or believe they just happen and im just noticing. cause like for instance if i think ill see such and such names today but it wont have to do with my narrative then i wont. but if i do? ill still be thinking i somehow made it happen or something did and reality isnt what i think.</data>

  <data key="d1">let me ask you this though why cant they just be coincidences though. like coincidences exist. this is the point i had to get to. i was always placing meaning on every single thing i saw and every coincidence that would happen. this was not the right approach. the thing is we live in a world with so many possibilities. i still have weird coincidences that happen just like everyone else does. it is a part of life and as much as i tried to change it i could not. life throws out so many possibilities. how i move on from them is just by saying it could have meant something but also could have just been a coincidence. what i want you to work on is to try to eliminate the smaller ones from your worries, especially the ones that are probable. im sure you could think of many small ones that happen. dont hesitate dming me if you would rather share on there. i hope this helps.</data>

  <data key="d1">as far as wisdom teeth is concerned, youre already a few days in and your sockets should have healed enough. just bring the necessary medications with you, and follow the instructions given to you. if you are worried about addiction from opioids same here because yes, they work really well then simply stop taking them. return them to your doctor so they can properly dispose of them, or limit use for when absolutely necessary covid, ibs, forgetting something, these things cant be controlled. take necessary safety precautions, get vaccinated or wear a mask, find medicationremedies that reduce ibs flares, and just remember to take whats necessary. if you forgot it, its probably not important. vacations are adventures, its not going to be determined. both good and bad</data>

  <data key="d1">anxiety is so good at making us feel guilty and like burdens for how we feel and for what we need. one symptom and side effect of anxiety is too entirely withdrawal and disconnect from people i did the same thing. i hid it and i isolated. even when people asked me how i was i lied. and then in therapy my therapist said if your friend called you and said hey im so anxious right now i dont know what to do i feel like im going crazy, would you be upset they called you? would be feel like they were a bother and i said of course not i love them and they shouldnt be alone and she said then why do you deserve to be alone? dont you think theyd wanna do the same? i didnt think i deserved that love but when reaching out to my loved ones and friends i found such love and community and support. even though my anxiety been really bad for almost like a year theyve never grown tired or frustrated. we are there for each others highs and lows. humans need connection to survive we are pack animals by instinct even when we are introverted or shy. anxiety tries to make us feel ashamed but we are battling one of the hardest battles that ever exists. fighting yourself in your head and feeling like youre going insane or youll die from this is so so freaking terrifying especially to handle alone. i just want you to know reaching out is okay youre not a burden. you are someone who is struggling something really heavy and if i could see you i would hug you or sit by you and help you carry some of that weight youre feeling. you are never alone in your feelings, youre never alone in this world. even if its just us strangers on reddit we love you and support you. emotions and anxiety are like the ocean it ebbs and flows. ive had times were ive had back to back panic attacks and thought i was dying for almost 24 hours straight and was half passed out from exhaustion between episodes of panic. but it ended. ive had some of the most depressed feelings ever like i was drowning for weeks and it ended. youre in pain and scared right now but you will survive this, this will end and you will come out of this anxiety attack. this is not forever. you are so strong and im so freaking proud of you for posting and reaching out. you are doing amazing, youre doing your best and thats enough even if thats just posting online or getting a drink or water. thats enough. you are enough. i really recommend asmr specifically karuna satori has some great panic attack ones ill list below my comment!</data>

  <data key="d1">dude here. there's no delicate way to say this, but i sometimes get bad haemorrhoids, and lose a fair bit of blood. i'm beginning to see a link to my worst anxiety. definitely have slight anaemia as per blood tests. now taking extra iron, might be helping? can't be sure, as trying multiple things. thought it might be analytically relevant, and if so worth embarassing myself.</data>

  <data key="d1">i was at work im a dog groomer have my own business throughout the day i was having breathing episodes as i call them, unable to get that deep breath. but i kept going. it got so bad i started freaking out a little more, then im grooming and my whole body was anxious and i started shaking. i was ready to send everyone home, i was anxious and so afraid. so finally i needed to stop. i put all the dogs away for a bit and went and laid on the couch in my waiting room. i found a youtube video for anxiety meditation. it was 10 minutes. halfway through i started calling down after the video i could breath. it was at the moment i realized i was ok, i can do this. i havent been that bad since that day, but when i feel a breathing epsiode coming i now go to that 10 minute video and just shut everything out for 10 minutes reminding myself i am ok yes i can breath</data>

  <data key="d1">if you are worried about strokes better visit a doctor and ask them for a ddimer blood test. if your ddimer is high then you blood is prone to clotting and may cause strokes. if not you are just needlessly stressing yourself. other than that if you can really afford get ct angio of the brain which should reveal if there are any clots in your brain. get your blood work to ensure you are getting sufficient vitamin like d, and b12 whose deficiencies cause tingling numbing sensations too.</data>

  <data key="d1">a warning about the ddimer test, though ddimer can be high for a bunch of reasons. this includes inflammation, injury, infection, etc. it is not used to diagnose pes, strokes, or heart attacks, it's just used to rule out clots. it's not used to diagnose them because it's so general and can rise for any little thing wrong in the body. don't freak out if your ddimer is high. my first true panic attack i felt like i was having a heart attack so i went to the er, and my ddimer was high. naturally, i freaked out, but every other test was fine ct, xray, etc. they couldn't find anything wrong with me. this happened a few times and it kicked off my health anxiety because i was always wondering if they missed something. 2 years later and i'm still here. we never found out what it was. so, moral of the story ddimer is very finicky and can be high for any number of reasons. it is not used to diagnose clots, just rule them out.</data>

  <data key="d1">its probably not a stroke but doesnt hurt to get it checked out. i worked with a lady who showed up for work and we all noticed something was off. we had to tell her half her face was limp and she didnt even know it. she said her arm fell asleep on her way in but thought it was from having it up on the steering wheel. they made her go to the hospital and it turned out to be a stroke. ive got two heart defects that make me more likely to have a stroke or heart attack so im always paranoid if my chest gets tight or my feethands are numb but its never anything serious. eta she drove for close to an hour like that, it went numb about 40 minutes into her 1.5 hr drive to work.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've had the exact same thing on and off and sometimes it goes away completely and then comes right back after a while i have health anxiety and i've been freaking out over all the unusual symptoms i've been experiencing since 2020. i used to be so normal and i barely ever felt any sort of anxiety but the pandemic has ruined me. i don't know if you suffer from health anxiety but if you do this might be the main cause. just constantly overthinking and constantly having those bad scenarios in your head. i know it's hard to try not to think about it but you have to push yourself to do that. and tell yourself that you're okay. i personally use positive affirmations and it's been working fine for me but sometimes you have to fight against it and really force yourself to think positive. at least this is what i've done in my case. some days are really hard to just function. but if you ever need to talk about this i'm always here</data>

  <data key="d1">i hated buspirone, how long have you been on it? they told me it might make me tired but it made me go from having insomnia to having insanely bad insomnia. would be up for like 48 hours sometimes, i just felt really off when i was on it. anxiety can make you dizzy and light headed for sure, it messes with your blood pressure. have they ever given you anything like clonidine? when they wanted to put me back on benzos as needed i wanted to try every alternative, i had been on klonopin before and didnt want anything that strong. anyway, clonidine was one medication they gave me, didnt work for my panic attacks but did work for when my anxiety was really bad. i had to go on valium for severe panic attacks but they kept me on the clonidine as needed as well. it worked really well for when i was just really overwhelmed. when i was stressed my ears would get like this low rumbling kind of noise in them when i would talk and it was like i couldnt hear myself speak or didnt know how loud i was speaking. i would shake really bad and get kind of dizzy plus had the insomnia, it helped with all of that. clonidine is a blood pressure medication, draw back is it can make you sleepy. oddly enough i was diagnosed with add about a year ago and going on adderall and addressing the add helped me so much. went from being on 4 different meds for my depression and anxiety to 2 meds adderall and lamotrigine for mood swings. i was so worried about the adderall making my insomnia worse but it went away after i started on that. it took 12 years to get down to the root cause of it all lol.</data>

  <data key="d1">i can't tell you how much your response resonated with me. i've suddenly developed really bad health anxiety. recently the anxiety got so bad i was having panic attacks multiple times a day, and when my face started going numb on the right side i was sent to the er for possible stroke. thankfully everything was fine, but my mind still won't accept that the numbness is anxiety related. i google symptoms and feel immediate panic when i think it could be ms. i'm trying meds now for the anxiety, and they helped for a while, the numbness went away and would only come back when i'd feel a rush of anxiety so it feels very clearly linked. but now it's like my anxiety is fighting back. i'm doing therapy, and meds to try and help and it just seems to be getting worse. it's really hard to function when my mind keeps going down the path of what health issue it could really be, because i just don't trust myself anymore. i'm afraid of going down the road of getting test after test and becoming a hypochondriac, but part of me also thinks if i don't get clear testing done i'll never be able to settle down. it's so exhausting constantly being worried like this.</data>

  <data key="d1">this all resonates with me so much. never really had anxiety before than i discovered i have gerd via thinking i was having a heart attack....i wasnt. now i get these weird face sensations. usually right temple, eye and my forehead. when things are bad my left upper lip and side of my face also feels off. the best way to describe it it feels like my skin is twitching, but when i look in the mirror nothing! very rarely i might get an actual twitch in my left lip. had ct and mri. nothing. been to er twice and did the stroke tests and everything is fine. i cant believe its anxiety but all the docs say it is. starting taking brintellix on docs advice. my biggest issue in believing is what comes 1st, the anxiety or the face sensations. to me it always feels like the face sensations come 1st.</data>

  <data key="d1">this just started happening to me a couple of days ago, the right side of my mouth and cheek, like where my moustache and beard would grow feels so off and weirdly tight. when i touch it, it's like i just came out of oral anesthesia. i had probably one of the most stressful weeks of my life thus far, so it could just be my body breaking down due to exhaustion and i asked one of my nurse friends and she said i have a calcium deficiency but it's starting to spread further up my cheek and face to my eyebrow. but i'm so scared, dude, i set up an appointment with my doctor because this and another symptom occasional dizzy spells that only last a couple of seconds tops and have zero connection with each other or reg timing i've been getting lately line up with early signs for multiple sclerosis.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes it's a standard practise. about luvox and other meds, it's all available on the internet. about gad you should be more careful about what you read, so you wouldn't read any misinformation. it's important to read only articles written by experts. thankfully gad, even thought terrible, is incredibly simple. it's all from having low tolerance of uncertainty. that's where all this anxiety is coming from. to stop it, besides medication, you must not seek reassurance about your fears and instead keep yourself in uncertainty on purpose in order to build the tolerance of uncertainty back up. and with specific fears it's good to do what is called erp or exposures. meaning exposing yourself to specific fears on purpose and also creating tolerance to them.</data>

  <data key="d1">as someone that went a whole year of having chest pain mimicking what you're having it's probably just anxiety. i also had the whole slew ran on me and all seemed fine but i still had pain and trouble. about 2 months later from talking to my cardiologist i started a new job and just sort of forgot about it. it just went away. the fear is still there from time to time and i'm always hyper aware of heart rate changes and palpitations. however the physical pain is gone. comes sometimes but still. maybe you'll have an anxiety free day and realize it might just be that.</data>

  <data key="d1">due to gout and other issues ive dealt with chronic pain for awhile. honestly my back was the one part of my body that didnt hurt everyday. ive tried transitioning to sales and other desk type jobs but never been able to sit at a desk and typework. i didnt finish school for the same reason. it definitely doesnt help that i have pretty severe adhd. when im working on my feet however, i seem to be able to organize a workflow and be productive. not to shoot down your suggestion, but i dont think a desk job is for me. the pain is just something ill have to deal with. you make a great point about the firebell though, this is something ive noticed with other chronic pain. definitely something to keep an eye on and help me recognize where my anxiety is coming from. i think my struggle lies with learning to manage my anxiety in whatever job i go back to. i think at most jobs people have to deal with someone whos in their face about something, im worried how i will react to that, when fight, flight or freeze arent good options.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah, as the other commenter said, thats just wholly not true. a lot of people, especially in rural areas, only get their dogs rabies vaxxed if something happens and theyre forced to, such as your dogs get loose and are collected by animal control. then animal control will ask about vaccine status and fine you unless you remedy. especially with these mobile shot clinics, you can just lie and say you went to one of those but dont have the paperwork on hand. as much as i know its going to get me downvoted, im one of these people. my dogs are in my yard nearly constantly, the only one i keep regularly up to date is the one that has to be groomed, and even then most mobile groomers dont ask for shot records, you just pay a premium to have them come to you. in my county, youre not required to have a rabies tag even. youre supposed to have them vaxxed but you dont have to pay the county registration fee for the tag unless you want to. a lot of vets around here include it in their shot fee because otherwise no one would ever pay for it.</data>

  <data key="d1">new jobs are scary if you suffer from anxiety. it's a combination of a new environment, new people, responsibility. since you're already scheduled for a visit, i don't see anything else you can do until then. just try to get enough sleep and eat and drink enough before going to work.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know that feeling, it's generalized anxiety. to make it better you must not try to make it stop. don't try to snap out of it or calm down. allow yourself to feel it in full force. that way you're creating tolerance to it, making it less powerful as a result.</data>

  <data key="d1">its important to realize excitement share many of the same physical symptoms of anxiety. also, i am willing to bet theres more underlying things causing a panic attack than a new job. i can be wrong but just my opinion without knowing you. but i would recommend therapy. most likely they will just give you pills and send you on your way which isnt exactly ethical. you should strive to be able to learn coping skills and strategies through therapy and not rely on medication unless all other avenues have been tested.</data>

  <data key="d1">you know what dude, i'm kind of right there with you. just like you, i was with my friend at our dorm, just smoked some weed, playing some smash bros, and just randomly had my first anxiety attack. it felt like a bad trip. didn't get am ambulance, but i spent the rest of my day alone. anxiety has lingered ever since them. it's terrible. years of medication failed. personality completely changed. known to be outgoing, partier, funny, happy, then just kinda became a sad, timid shell. i also blame the weed but i could never bring myself to permanently quit. i need it to eat because i've always been underweightmalnourished. recently diagnosed as anorexic so even though i hate being high, it really feels like i have to smoke so i actually eat food.</data>

  <data key="d1">i was in your spot not to long ago like 89 months ago now i had panic attacks i couldnt workout or drive. deff stay away from smoking or any drugs. stay away from stimulants like nicotine and caffeine. quit smoking and drinking any alcohol, eat better and work on getting quality sleep. honestly this isnt a do 1 thing to fix this problem its a whole change up that you have to do try all the things people tell you to do, meditate, drink tea, breath. it will go away but if you neglect yourself it could also come back with a vengeance i was almost afraid to leave my house at some point. try not to avoid the things that have given you anxiety or panic attacks, just take them in slowly some people drive there for a week, go inside as the next week, only do walking for a week, start lifting ect until theyre comfortable being in the gym. you can use this with everything else you feel gives you panic attacks</data>

  <data key="d1">pretty much this. small bouts of exposure to things that trigger your anxiety is only really the way to overcome the task or tasks in question. whether it be with the help of friends or on your own. i myself suffer anxiety, but i'd say most of it has cleared up just by having a good support circle, changing diet low carb no added sugars. i cannot emphasize more how this was the key factor in my anxiety lessoning, along with the brain fog, having a focus, timing my caffeine intake more appropriately no caffeine past 11am, as caffeine has a 812 hour half life, taking walks 4.5km loop, in the morning or in the evening depending on my mood and schedule, exercising and getting more deep sleep thanks to the changes. it's not an overnight fix by any means, took me 5 years to acquire what works for me, what would seem like mundane trivial tasks to most actually mean a lot to my hyper sensitive smol brain. remember, we all have the ability to do great things, we just haven't found it yet and thats perfectly alright. thee who exposes themself to the uncomfortable can then become comfortable. i wish you all the best 3</data>

  <data key="d1">there may actually be a physiological aspect to the panic attack from smoking. as you inhale the smoke, it may burn your throat and lungs, causing some pain, discomfort, andor tightness. pair that with a sudden burst of random thoughts and hyper awareness of your body and its senses. its a perfect recipe for feeling like youre having a heart attack i.e. panic attack. you may try a different form of thc i.e. an edible, however, your brain has already associated thc with anxiety so it might be difficult to continue using weed at all.</data>

  <data key="d1">it was rough in the beginning. i started by using nicotine pouches for a couple weeks when i quit vaping, and tapered the pouches each week. eventually, i quit the pouches. i used sugar free candy to help with the nicotine withdrawals. i think, besides the nicotine, the thing i had craved was the amazing flavors that vapes came in.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have panic disorder and agoraphobia so my options are quite limited in terms of exercise. for me i started with yoga, super easy gentle videos yoga with bird on youtube and then i slowly eased into doing pilates workouts also on youtube, i still struggle some days and end up just going yoga or not doing anything at all but, using a youtube video gave me a lot of freedom and choice of when where and also stopping whenever i need too . for me i exercise for my anxiety not for health or fitness so i just do super simple things to keep myself moving. going for walks or runs can be great too</data>

  <data key="d1">my advise is if smoking makes you feel worse, stop it sooner rather than later im assuming its weed youre talking about i smoked heavily for years and at the time felt it was helping me but it was actually making me worse. i ended up having to take weeks off work because i was nearing a break with reality. i was smoking a lot and extremely paranoid. if youre mentally ill, regardless of what people might tell you. weed is not your friend. imo</data>

  <data key="d1">i can imagine different scenario how this could happen thc binds canabinoids receptors or anandamide receptors on the neurons. this bound leads to a diminution of the neuron activity diminution of the number of neurotransmetters it releases. on a bigger scale, it decreases the excitability of neurons networks even inhibitory neurons! if inhibitory neurons are inactivated other neurons become overactivated. we know it s the case for dopaminergique neurons and thc. it s why we often feel joy and pleasure while smoking. maybe a similar dynamic exists between thc and noradrenaline receptors. neurotransmitter for stress response which share similar structure with dopamine some people with an anxious background may response more strongly to this effect than other. because more neuron connection involving this emotion x200b another reason less complex could be the thc forces the brain to change its activity towards a general lower activity of the network. we like control, specially if we are prone to anxiety. every situation making us feel that we are losing control may trigger fea in response. this stress response would pushes us getting the control back. another reason could involve plasticity the thc lower the general activity of the network ,and it s not very specific. hence, only bigger and most important neuron pathsroutes of the network may continue to work normally. imagine a shortage in asphalt to repair the roads of a city. it s logical to repair most important roads in priority. hence, if anxiety is a strong component of your mind. even if all of your functions are lower down, you may still feel the anxiety. i often see that people who have smoked for years tend to get stuck in the same habits, reinforce specific pattern of thinking and, have a lot of difficulties to make change in their life. the laziness. when you work with half a brain it becomes very hard to change your habits, even your habits of smoking! yes cannabis has good sides effect as well and i m not a doctor. but i would not recommend it to relieve your anxiety. many people have developed panic attack after or while smoking strong dose or regular dose. i would suggest to ask a doctor for meds for a rapid effect. he ll probably go for benzodiazepine otherwise meditation, sport, no more caffeine , minimum fast sugar, sauna are working well for me.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm sure there are plenty of people who are overly anxious about it. just remember, this is nothing new. china and russia have, for as long as i've been alive, tested the us military. long range bombers and fighter jets encroaching us airspace. submarines feet from us waters. overtly dangerous flybys on us naval ships, etc. the reality is, this is all just a game. china has the means to spy via satellite already. not to mention their proliferation of technology used by us consumers. and, honestly, the reason the military doesn't seem overly concerned about it? they've likely already hacked or blocked the device from transmitting. but, in the end, china relies heavily on the west for its economy. a nuclear war wouldn't do much to help boost manufacturing in china.</data>

  <data key="d1">ok, start by taking a deep breath and slowing down. you are spinning your wheels panicking, and that won't help you. if you haven't had enough water and food today, go grab a snack and a drink preferably without caffeine before anything else. maybe take a walk around the block and get some fresh air for a few minutes. that might get you out if that cycle and into a productive headspace. feel a little calmer? let's continue. next, you are looking at all of these problems and worries when what you need to do right now is focus on the problem at hand the assignment and how to do it. you can worry about your other worries when that assignment is done and you are in a better headspace. this won't be ignoring those problems. this is just about prioritizing the immediate issue over longerterm ones. if you are having a hard time silencing these biggerpicture problems, keep reading, and we'll come back to those. step 3 what is the problem at hand? what is this anxiety stemming from? is the assignment itself overwhelmingly difficult andor complex? will you have to present the project and you have stagefright? are you afraid of the assignment and those bigger concerns popped up after you started panicking, or is your anxiety about the assignment stemming from these bigger concerns? heck, if you aren't sure why you are anxious, maybe you are just anxious about being anxious your body is in fightorflight mode because of the importance of the assignment but you've interpreted that feeling as fear rather than determination. in short is the anxiety stemming from the assignment, the situation, or your body? step 4 really depends on your answer to number 3 though a few strategies overlap. your goal here is to calm your panicking and shift yourself into thinking mode. if you like brain stuff, this means calming the limbic system and stimulating the pfc. some possible tactics include 1 writing a list of every step in the process of the assignment. potentially also smarting a schedule. 2 asking a friend or classmate to be a study buddy. they don't even need to be doing the assignment. they'll just be there as a grounding and calming presence. you'll be less likely to panic if no one around you is doing the same. for long term assignments, you can maybe even check in with the teacher to see if you are on the right track. 3 talk yourself up. not smart? you have a 4.0 in what sounds like some sort of difficult career path. you've done hundreds of similar assignments to get here, what's one more? even if you don't know how you got here, you are here. besides, imposter syndrome is a normal fear in academia, and you have to recognize what it is you don't know in order to learn more the dunningkruger effect. a lot of these are results of being smart. not brave? bravery is not the absence of fear. it's the decision to not be ruled by it. you may not have control over your fear, but if you are still on this path, it isn't in control either. frankly, that's a better indicator of bravery than someone who is too stupid to recognize danger. give yourself permission to be proud of how hard you've fought and how far you've come. 4 longer term, you may want to get professional help. your school likely has some resources, but you can also try to find an outside therapist. key phrases to look for include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, imposter syndrome, and cognitive behavioral therapy. anxiety is not an easy fight without the right tools. a therapist can help you win. any questions? hope this helps.</data>

  <data key="d1">for me those sharp pains are a result of muscle issues on my back, they cause stabbing like pain in front of my chest. my chest also feels 'tight' when i breathe. as an immediate relief i try to straighten my back and do some stretches to open my chest. i also use a foam roller for my back and do guided meditation exercises that focus on breathing. as a more long lasting solution, i've been to physiotherapy and had my back be massaged there. i've also gotten some tips for at home exercises. anxiety causes me to subconsciously clench my muscles, which over time leads to pretty bad tightness in them, which i don't necessarily even realise until someone massages my back.</data>

  <data key="d1">i always thought my shortness of breath was a result of my past smoking and the fact that i cant breathe fully just gives me more anxiety. it didnt occur to me until recently that it was because of my anxiety. my body is in constant panic and it doesnt go away until i focus on something else. wether it be a tv show, a video game, a good book, i have to take my brains focus away from my breathing in order for it to feel normal again. i always feel like im in fight or flight mode and it just gets worse if i think about it. it may not totally work for you, but you could try to shift your focus onto something else. fixate on that show youre watching or that puzzle youve been working on, and just focus your brain for a while. i tend to lose myself in the shows i watch at work so that my anxiety about being there isnt so bad. hope this makes sense</data>

  <data key="d1">ive been dealing with the chest discomfort this past week. it feels almost as if ive strained my lungs slightly when i breathe, but also a bit of heartburn sensation. hard to explain. but i also catch myself tensing my sternum from stress and anxiety and my back is super tight. i think my back tightness has a bit to do with it. ive been checked out pretty thoroughly multiple scans etc. throughout the past 6 months and everything has been fine. feels very worrisome. my brother had dealt with the disassociation out of body thing quite a bit and psych meds helped him. have you tried hydroxyzine? its an antihistamine that acts as sort of a very light less scary version of xanax.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing severe anxiety and panic attacks. it can be challenging to manage these symptoms, but there are several strategies that may be helpful. here are some suggestions 1. seek alternative treatment options if your doctor is not willing to prescribe medication, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor for support. therapy can be an effective treatment option for anxiety and panic attacks and can help you learn coping strategies to manage your symptoms. 2. practice selfcare medications are not magical solutions you also need to work on yourself. take care of yourself by eating well, getting enough sleep, and engaging in physical activity. also, try to engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as reading, painting, or listening to music. 3. cognitive behavioral therapy cbt cbt is a type of talk therapy that can help you identify and change negative patterns of thinking and behavior that contribute to anxiety and panic attacks. check mindphony to learn about cbt. 4. mindfulnessbased therapies mindfulness practices, such as meditation and deep breathing, can help you stay focused on the present moment and reduce symptoms of anxiety and panic. check aura app. it's important to remember that seeking help for mental health concerns is a brave and important step towards recovery. if you're having trouble finding a mental health professional who can support you, consider reaching out to a local mental health organization or support group for additional resources and support.</data>

  <data key="d1">i appreciate that you're looking for ways to alleviate your symptoms and understand that medication may be one of the options you're considering. however, i would like to caution you about the use of benzodiazepines as a treatment, such as alprazolam xanax, clonazepam klonopin, diazepam valium, and lorazepam ativan. these medications have the potential to be addictive and cause unwanted side effects. before making a decision, it's crucial to have an open and informed conversation with your doctor about the potential risks and benefits of benzodiazepines, to ensure you make a safe and informed choice.</data>

  <data key="d1">not a cat, but my pug ran away when i was a teen and she came waddling back on her own three days later. i was an anxious wreck, couldn't go to class, spent hours hanging up posters... and then she just came back when i was about to give up hope. i hope your kitty shows up soon! it's the worst feeling. but it sounds like you're doing everything right so far.</data>

  <data key="d1">a few weeks ago, my grandcat escaped out my son's window. she is a indoor cat only. but she saw her chance to live on the wild side and took it. i woke up the next day and went to feed the dogs outside. and there she was ready to come in and sleep. i didn't even know she had escaped. your cat will be back. if she isn't fixed, you might need to quickly make an appt though.</data>

  <data key="d1">this is going to sound insane cause it did to me, but i was talking with my girlfriend at valentines day dinner literally 2 days ago and the question when did you know you liked me came up. her reply within the first 5 minutes of our first date. we were sitting at the table waiting for a waiter, you looked at me and just told me you were anxious and nervous and cracked a joke about it. i was too. just knowing it was okay to feel that way and that you had the emotional maturity to say that out loud was comforting. it's eating me up because i function perfectly normal in group settings, even with her.. but the moment we're one on one, it's like she's stacking debuffs on me. i may just be overanalyzing it.. but i feel like she's got to think something is up... first off, lol at the debuffs comment. made me giggle. second, this is how it feels when you like someone! it's natural. you want to make a move and there's a risk it will or won't work so you're nervous. it's uncomfortable but healthy, and all the more exciting if it does work. be careful cause you work together, stay respectful and don't say or do anything sexual. but i say just be honest and make a joke of it. you know what i love doing? calling out when stuff is weird and awkward and whatever like right now, do you wanna get coffee sometime? the hardest part is saying something like that with confidence. rehearse it if you gotta, but confidence changes a situation, even if it's fake confidence! i get told every time i confess to someone that i have really bad anxiety that you're the last person i'd expect to have anxiety. i workout, have lots of tats, some piercings, try to come off confident, etc. maybe as a way to compensate tbh lol. i say that so that you know you're not alone and literally anyone you see could be dealing with the same thing you are.</data>

  <data key="d1">thanks so much! i think my best approach, which also resonates with what you are saying is to just be transparent and honest. the reality of it is that i want to build a relationship with her. even if it isn't intimate. i haven't a clue why, but she is just so captivating and borderline inspiring.. despite she hasn't revealed anything particularly astonishing. it's got to be how she converses, like she is engaged in conversation aside from typical getmeover small talk. maybe it's just highbeam smitten and my senses are just temporarily amplified. i'm certainly not going to push allin. maybe when i get a moment, i'll give her my number and invite her to text or call if she ever wants to talk about anything. i think asking for her number is a bit too bold. i don't want to miscommunicate that i am seeking to contact her. i'd rather meaningful exchanges at her pace. putting myself in her shoes, i wouldn't want to pick up some maniac who doesn't respect personal space. even if she were to chuck it in the trash, i think i'd sleep soundly knowing i gave it a rip with minimal fallout.</data>

  <data key="d1">you're welcome! one piece of advice is to be clear on what you're looking for from her. it sounds like you want something romantic, so don't be ambiguous with her. doesn't mean you run up to her wiener in hand obviously. if a coworker that you didn't know likes you that you just chat with casually randomly gave you their phone number and say to text me, it's a bit of a weird experience. it works more if it's a girl giving it to a guy, fair or unfair it just is what it is, but not often as a guy to a girl unless you know she likes you. i'm assuming you're a guy here, but generally speaking ladies like a guy who is confident. cocky is not confident though some toxic girls do like that...and some toxic guys like the inverse. you can be confident and kind. that's what i strive for. if your intention is to get to know her more with the goal of being in a relationship with her if you find that you guys continue to get long, then be clear on that in your head. confidence is hard. i'm not saying this stuff is easy. i would say be clear, but not rude. find something unique you can compliment her on if you feel so compelled. maybe she's wearing nice makeup that day, something unique not i like your shoes or something lol. all the youtube alpha male gurus are full of shit, so avoid them like the plague. i don't even want to name them. i'm rooting for you! a new relationship is exciting and trying to build is is nerve wracking as hell. if i can be of any help, please reach out!</data>

  <data key="d1">no, it won't cause irreversible damage. the medication is meant to be used in tandem with therapy. use it specifically as prescribed and focus on yourself the safe amount is the amount your doctor prescribed and if you accidentally forget to take or, or take another a few hours later because you forgot just call a pharmacy. if you feel those boxes may become a crutch, this a perfect time to address that. you'll be okay. make sure you're in honest communication with the prescription provider, and let it help your body while you fix yourself. you got this!</data>

  <data key="d1">yes, the withdrawals can cause irreversible damage use them as prescribed but remember that there's a good reason they're pretty much never prescribed anyone advocating for gaba receptor agonist or anything alike usage or downplaying their serious detrimental effects should consider doing research on why these classes of medication are bad using agonist usually downstream overtime result in lower receptor quantity thats only one of the few reasons not to take benzos, and only one of the many reasons why you're not supposed to take them long term as an agonist will basically lower the amount of gaba receptors in your brain and once you stop the medication you have higher baseline anxiety because the receptors are used to mediate your anxiety, so imagine having less receptors overtime the receptors should theoretically return to normal as your bodybrain tries to reach a medium but this is why people who take benzos whine about the withdrawalscoming off of them because you will get painful brain zaps and other issues if you use them too long and too frequently</data>

  <data key="d1">if ive learned something its that it totally and wholly depends on your biochemistrygenetic makeup. some people can take a low dose once for a few weeks and have the most horrendous time coming off. others like myself have no tolerancedependence issues. ive been taking benzos as needed for 6 years. sometimes months would go by without me taking it and sometimes i would take it for a few weeks every day. ive never had any noticeable withdrawals so for me personally it has been a miracle drug to get me through really rough times. i have decided incidentally after making a post here that i will take an extended break from taking any benzos to see how i cope. its been over a week and i feel surprisingly good. i think i have become so mentally dependent on it that i believed i couldnt function without it. turns out i can after all. and if i find myself in a rough spot again i know its always there if i need it. i think it would be a good idea for you to take a break from the benzos to see how it affects you. either taper off or stop taking it if you feel the withdrawals are minimal and see how you feel. if the withdrawals are rough then it might be a good sign to do a long enough taper wi minimal discomfort before you find yourself in a whole world of pain.</data>

  <data key="d1">100 will cause addiction and theyre unbelievably hard to get off once youre addicted. you get a lot of rebound anxiety basically meaning when you quit your anxiety is 10x worse than what it was before you started taking the meds. along with physical addictions. people have actually died from benzo withdrawal. it has such a negative effect on your body. not only while on them but when you suddenly stop. it can take years to taper off of them when youre addicted. id suggest taking them only when you really need them. which is hard cause theyre a great crutch to lean on and go through days with no anxiety. but its better to find a way to deal with it without medicine than lean on the meds to stop it.</data>

  <data key="d1">i take 6mg of ativan a day and have been for years and i know im dependent 100 but its helped me tremendously and changed my life so i can work and do thing daily and live my life. i know the dangers of benzos but i use mine as prescribed and my life as done nothing but turn around and be better. i think some people really can have a use for them in the long term. i used to be stuck in bed and couldnt move or work out or literally do anthony without passing out from panic attacks. no alcohol nothing, just bad bad panic. all im saying is me and dr are always on the same page he knows everything, we both realized that lorazepam daily is working for me with my ssri. been doing it for years and my quality of life has been drastically better</data>

  <data key="d1">the whole benzodiazepine fear is really destroying the people that need it.. i'm 100 dependent on it too.. however it did save my life and now have a beautiful girlfriend and a career that i love. if it were to be taken away, i would have constant panic attacks and would not he able to work or enjoy my life. there needs to be a different discourse on benzodiazepines. but it seems though, however, everyone that is prescribed it long term, are considered drug addicts.</data>

  <data key="d1">idk where your trauma comes from but for my childhood trauma, inner child work was lifechanging. writing letters to myself at the age when traumatic things happened was so freeing. i still go back and read them sometimes. also, while i haven't done dbt with a dbt therapist, just researching it and trying out the skills on my own has been helpful as well. also, i totally understand the losing hope feeling. i've been suffering for years from anxiety, depression, and a bunch of other things. and i worked really hard in therapy for 3 years only to be told that i have borderline personality disorder and that i will probably be like this for the rest of my life. i know remission is possible but sometimes, i feel like i'm not making any progress at all. i do get hopeless sometimes, but i try to remind myself of all the horrible things i've pushed through to show myself that i have a lot of strength that i often just brush off. i'm sure the same could be said about you.</data>

  <data key="d1">it seems like your thoughts must be racing a million miles an hour by how youre typing. hun you need to start off by breathing deeply for at least a good minute or two. youre panicking and not breathing properly which will heighten all physical symptoms you have. i can guarantee you that you are not having a heart attack because i get similar symptoms these are all just caused by anxiety. youre also having some health anxiety and your mind is clouded by the panic so youre not able to think logically so we need to get you to that point. in order to get you there we need to start with breathing and after some breathing i want you to do some grounding and after some grounding i want you to get in the shower or bath. now when you reach a relaxed state i want you to become mindful of these symptoms and analyze them and exactly what it is your feeling. i want you to question what youre feeling and ask yourself what the probability of this actually being a medical emergency is or just anxiety. i think that youll find out through rationalization that this is just anxiety and youre just putting your fear behind physical symptoms. also, if youre doing research on these symptoms youre going to end up trying to self diagnose and your body will start to mimic the symptoms. also also, this could just be a pinched nerve or pulled muscle. i promise you that you are safe.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey !! i struggle this derealisation which is basically episodes of thinking everything is fake, so i completely understand exactly what you are feeling right now, because i have felt it too firstly, tackle the panicky scared feeling and then tackle the thoughts. ground yourself to pull back from panic 5things you can see, 4things you can tough, 3things you can hear, 2things you can smell and 1thing you can taste. put something cold on either the back of your neck like an ice pack or your wrists run under cold water or both ! count in a difficult times table, like 7, to get your brains energy focusing on something different. now tackle the thoughts, thinking that things arent real. realistically, something that these two films have in common are that when the characters are doubting their reality, they arent allowed to do that, to have those thoughts. just the fact that you are questioning if everything is fake, proves everything is real !because if everything was fake, you wouldnt even be able to form those thoughts. and even the fact that these films exist, back up that philosophy if everything was fake, we wouldnt have this media to consume because we wouldnt be able to have those ideas. also, if you ever feel like everything isnt real, if you can do things like use your phone, read the time, read words, and have 5 fingers on each hand, you are real ! you cant do those things i just listed in dreams, so if you can do them, you ! are ! real ! everything ! is ! real ! this feeling is one of the scariest things ive experienced, partly because i couldnt explain it to other people but just know, i understand. there are many people on this app who understand, many people on this planet who understand this is not an individual experience, so dont let it isolate you ! finally, i know its difficult, but if you can, if you know this type of media is triggering, try and avoid it or remove yourself from a situation that you know could trigger this feeling. i would also recommend telling people you trust that you experience this, so that if it does happen, you have someone close to you who can help ! this will pass, i hope things get better for you</data>

  <data key="d1">hey man i had my first panic attack back in october that was really bad and intense for two weeks i felt so tired and lazy and felt like i would have another one but overtime your body will build energy and you'll be able to exercise again also if you very anxious everyday exercise can make you feel more tired and lazy and even when you do have rest days and go back to exercising you still feel like you can't exercise or you give up fast because your anxiety takes your energy away</data>

  <data key="d1">i am sorry to hear about your first panic attack being in october. i hope you are doing better now! remember take as much time as you need to feel better yeah, throughout the day i feel fine, but when i start doing something with some activities i just experience anxiety attack symptoms and get quickly out of breath. its so annoying cuz i always read that excercise makes your anxiety better, but i cant even excercise to make me feel better.</data>

  <data key="d1">you are so young still! as long as you are able to, try just focusing on yourself! if its possible to see a therapist i highly suggest that. also there are so many different medications to try. it sometimes takes a bit to find what works for you. i had a lot of luck with generic brand of celexa for about 10 years and now im on generic brand of lexapro. you have to give it time. unfortunately treatment is always going to be weeks, if not months of work. you got this!</data>

  <data key="d1">also you can make good money doing photography! i know right now thinking about doing it for a career and having to deal with people is scary. but work on yourself and practice and maybe have friends let you take portraits. pet portraits is also a huge thing. you have so much time to decide what you can do. as long as your parents are supportive and arent rushing you out of the house. dont worry about needing to have it all figured out right now. im 37 and still dont know what i want to be when i grow up! lol i have a 16yr old son also 13yr old son and 5 yr old daughter but my son being the oldest, i constantly tell him to just enjoy being a kid right now. dont worry about working. dont worry about having to have it all figured out! thats what im here for, for now! and they have no pressure to move out, ever if they want! you will be ok and you will figure it out!</data>

  <data key="d1">hi, you must avoid telling yourself the past mistakes were good or bad. i'm not sure i'm wording this right. you must look at it for exactly what it is and not tell yourself maybe it's not that bad, but also not that it was really that bad. and don't try to feel good or bad about it. you have to look at it with a cold approach. that way the brain will slowly throw it out.</data>

  <data key="d1">sounds like typical anxiety attack, it is kind of odd that it wakes you up. but 110130 with no other symptoms does not sound like it could be an arrhythmia a serious one at least. pay attention to the rythm next time, if you feel any heart palpitations, feeling your heart in your throat, flutters, and a pounding sensation. if so it wouldnt heart to get an ecg done at your next check up. but doesnt sound like anything dangerous and is likely anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">okay, well i'd need to know more about your anxiety in general then. like do you have other fears? have you been to a psychiatrist or some other doctor about this? and are you taking meds? also it's important to adapt the habit of not trying to stop your anxiety when it's happening. this way you build resistance to it, making the anxiety weaker. same with no reassurance about whatever you're scared about.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's important to know remember that when you wake up your body pushes out adrenaline to aid with it. this causes your heart rate to rise. and if you ride that wave then your heart can really get going. if you've subconsciously become fearful of this then it'll kick into gear before you're even fully awake. i went through this for months. what really helped was essentially rolling over and telling myself it was ok and i was fine and doing a quick body scan meditation. still felt like crap for about a month but it started to let up. takes a while to reprogram things.</data>

  <data key="d1">had anxiety for almost 30 years and used to be a oral surgery assistant. honestly the anesthesia is the best nap you will ever take. you fall asleep quickly and peacefully and wake and its over. just time to go home and heal. one thing that helps a lot is if you tell the nurse how nervous you are they will usually walk you through everything. it helps</data>

  <data key="d1">i was scared about extracting teeth like you, but i can assure you, as myself who is someone who gets extremely anxious, you will be fine. anathestic is a godsend and you will nothing, 0 pain, i promise. just focus your mind on something else or count upwards till its done, just to not get anxious and take your mind off things whilst the dentist does hisher thing.</data>

  <data key="d1">my oral surgeon gave a script for diazepam to take before my surgery after i nearly decked his anesthesiologist the first time. it definitely helped as i dont remember much of the morning of at all. to speak to everyone else here though anesthesia sleep really is the best nap of your life. youll be loopy when you wake up and maybe feel like youre freezing cold but it clears up pretty quickly and everyone around you is gonna know why youre not making any sense so no need to feel embarrassed at all.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi! i too have anxiety i was around your age when i got my wisdom teeth out. i was also very anxious beforehand too a lot of what ifs and such. i will tell you that going under isn't nearly as scary as you think. anesthesiologists go to school for many many many years to keep you safe while surgery is happening so you're in good hands. plus, it's the best nap you'll ever take. i totally understand about lack of control but trust me when i say that wisdom teeth removal is a safe surgery and you are in the hands of a very educated person. i think i was only out for about 45 minutes as well. i had really bad impacted teeth so it was a little longer but i woke up in the little room just fine!</data>

  <data key="d1">i was in the same boat. i had 4 impacted wisdom teeth and put off wisdom tooth removal for 4 years because i was too scared. itll be scary, because theres a heart monitor and oxygen and other stuff that makes it feel more like youre going into surgery than you would expect. i was lucky my surgeon was really chill even though i had never met him. my fear was not waking up because i am overweight and had never been under anesthetic before. when i got hooked up, i told my surgeon im sorry, im really nervous, and he looks at me and says i have that effect around ladies and that was it, i clonked out. when i woke up, i came to really fast. it was a 30 minute drive home and pretty much woke up in that timeframe, enough that i actually accepted a job offer! its scary, but youll be alright, i promise</data>

  <data key="d1">i had a hard time moving out of my moms house when i was 19. i moved 30 mins away for the first year and that was fine but then we moved again this time 4 hours away to a new state. he got a job that was well paying so i decided to go with. i almost didnt though i really almost stayed home but for my son i wanted to try and make it work. that year i cried all the time! it was very far. no more lunch at my moms and easy babysitter lol. luckily my mom and dad would visit frequently and i also went back several times but it was very lonely at first until i got into work. once my son was a year and i started working and making my own friends in this town i definitely stopped feeling so lonely and missing my family so much. it also helps to keep in contact often. my mom calls me daily lol. even a 30 second call, its been 3 years now where i am and i love it. makes me appreciate the time with them allot more i think. youll be ok girl. its part of growing up.</data>

  <data key="d1">i can definitely relate to this and the anxiety of leaving family. its not living away for year or two, but last year i moved with my friends and boyfriend to another country for four months. did i have moments during that time that i missed my family and wished they were near? definitely. but i also had the most incredible time of my life and made some of my best memories to date that i will never be able to replicate. i look back and think im so, so glad i made the decision to live somewhere else for a while and experience something new. do it for yourself and for the incredible experiences you will gain. its always hard at first to break that barrier and get comfortable with family not being near, but i promise you that the memories and experiences you will make, especially in yours 20s, will be ones youll look back on and thank yourself for doing. your family will be there to support you and you will see them again when you return! youll also make time for phone and video calls to stay in touch during your time away. but i highly encourage that you take the time that you can now to enjoy life and all the incredible things the world has to offer. once you start, the anxiety starts to become easier to manage. its always hard at first, but it gets a lot easier! hope this helps and provides some comfort op.</data>

  <data key="d1">honestly you are being very smart by slowly getting back into work. being with your supporting boyfriend will probably help you a lot too. i can say from personal experiences that my mum would get mad about me not having a job but it was more the fact she wanted me to live my life. currently i can no longer work with my anxiety and mum has accepted this. volunteering at a dogs groomers has done me wonders and actually made me want that as my future career. i think you are doing great and everything takes time so dont beat yourself up. you are not a leech for being ill and you are not a coward for trying to get better. i really hope things look better and if you need to start a part time job its a start and explain that to your parents. even if its a letter as you cant handle the arguments. hope this helps and just enjoy this time with boyfriend</data>

  <data key="d1">learn to breathe and activate your parasympathetic nervous system. i used to wake up in the middle of the night with a heart rate of 150160 as well but when i learned proper breathing techniques my heart rate would slow down over a period of 1020 minutes to regular 6070 bpm. i now practice breathing every day and my heart rate has been significantly lower 50bpm while sleeping. watch your diet as well. a high fat high protein diet changed my life. cut out the sugar and stick with complex carbohydrates. its a long process but you will get there. keep up the exercise as well. i feel like its a daily requirement for people with anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">oh yea you have to be as calm as possible before exposing yourself. try deep breathing first before you expose yourself and when you start to feel anxious during the exposure try to work your way through the panic. dont fight it, work with it. let yourself be anxious and panic, but try to see how you can cope with it and manage it. be present. resisting your anxiety will only make it stronger.</data>

  <data key="d1">sounds like gad. that's my diagnosis. i don't know if you know this, you must not try to make the anxiety go away. that makes it come back more often and stronger. the correct approach is to allow yourself to feel the full force of it. that way you build resistance to it, making it less powerful. though you might also need medication to stop it completely.</data>

  <data key="d1">no, it's because everytime drs write a controlled substance, their names are recorded as doing so. it's 100 percent selfish. they are terrified out of their minds of overprescribing controlled medications and paranoid about getting in trouble. and you are right america is absolutely a suffer culture. the uk is a little worse in terms of benzos no, 2 mg of valium doesn't cut it and i think the us is a little worse in terms of pain meds, but both are bad. you do have a history with alprazolam and depending on when you went off it if it wasn't that long, you can threaten them with reporting them to the medical board for forcing you off medication that was working for you. this works but it depends on how oftenhow muchhow long since your last script. basically, remember doctors put themselves and their careers first if they know they'll get reported for not doing it, the are much more likely to prescribe it. i would certainly threaten on the untreated pain as well congress has just rolled back their opioid recommendations and basically said drs are going too far the other direction. you might try using that but don't ever expect a dr to care or want to talk about anything but addiction. i just tune it out. if you threaten, be sure to do it nicely and calmly and matter of factly or you'll be labeled a drug seeker. they may still do that but if so you can always just drop them and give them a nasty rating online as well as reporting unde treatment. it's very easy in the us to report a dr that's one of the few good things about the health system there</data>

  <data key="d1">hey there, this feels like something i f20 would have ghost wrote 2 years ago. as someone whose had health anxiety and has currently been health anxiety free for about 4 months now, i figured id give some advice. first of all, your feelings are extremely valid. especially with anxiety, a lot of the things we see and think in our head feels very real, especially those symptoms of pain. our brain is extremely powerful, it can make up symptoms and make them last for weeks take it from me, i had back problems for a month because i thought i had a growth in my back until i just decided to try and ignore it and a few days later it was gone. what youre focusing on right now in terms of pain is going to be a bit more noticeable and stronger because you are taking notice of it and focusing on those pains. try to keep busy and what ive found what works the best is staying around other people. secondly, and if youre going to take away any of this listen you this, stay off those health sites and subreddits. and i mean all of it. stop googling even the smallest of symptoms because more than likely itll come up as something life ending. its how websites get clicks and they feed off of it. if you really are concerned about a pain, add health anxiety reddit to the end. more than likely, itll show other threads of the same exact thing youre going through and sometimes its nice to see youre not alone. also if you can, try and stay away from media that involves sickness and health. its harder to do than say,especially since your mind is focused on that topic so youre going to recognize it more, but it helped me beat my anxiety in the long run. i also saw youre 14 so let me pull some statistics out which has helped me tremendously when i was in the worst of my health anxiety. cancer in teens is the lowest percent of cancer statistics ever. like only .05 of people your age get cancer in their teens. and even a lower percent pass away from it. heres a sub post that really goes into it which shows how unlikely it is youll get sick lastly, your doctors are not going to ignore a jarring symptom. thats something ive had to come to terms with. they see hundreds of patients weekly and they know when to run tests. next time you have a wellness check you can ask for a full body check up ask for blood work if possible and itll help put your mind at ease. if you have any questions at all please dont hesitate to ask. were all in this together</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you so much for this!! i definitely have a health issue going on but im just worried about possibly dying or having a near death experience because usually with symptoms like mine you have to wait awhile for appointments, tests, procedures and im worried it needs to be treated asap i developed this weird chest pain last month. it stopped with ppis for a few days but came back worse and everyday my symptoms are slightly different. i did go to the er though and got tests done which im safe but my concern is the no screenings on my stomach because its a gastro issue as my lungs and heart are healthy. the sorta scary thing is ive done tests blood test urine stool and the blood test and urine test again at the hospital which all came back okay and good so its weird and worrying when they cant figure it out but at the same time good tests are good. i did get an ultrasound waiting on results but as of now im waiting in pain everyday for my endoscopy and colonoscopy procedure to look for answers. so sometimes when the pain is super bad my brain wonders off to possibly developing a fever , or throwing up blood or something that can indicate a near death or serious situation. it hasnt happened which im grateful for but the pain can get very bad whats weird though was during the days the pain went away and i felt completely normal i noticed really bad headaches and convinced myself i had a brain tumor and went full on crazy with crying kicking my feet and everything but now i rather have that headache over this stomach issue more than anything</data>

  <data key="d1">so i feel my brain fog comes from my diet and exercise, at least im guessing. idk if it would help with derealization but cutting out gluten can help as well. ive cut out sugar like you have said but being on medications for so long, i found out my depression was treatment resistant and anxiety was hard to control. its crazy how much diet can effect your mental health but those are the steps im taking now. i hope you find something that works for you!</data>

  <data key="d1">when they're saying anxiety isn't real the subtext is not that it's not real but that is selfinduced thoughts and feelings. ask any therapist and they will tell you feelings are liars. some can be fleeting and some become more powerful based on the situation. the more powerful ones are often a result of extended internal or external stimuli response. humans have a hard time shutting down the emotional response after an event has ended. much like physically working out to gain more muscle mass, if you make note of when this anxiety arises and if there are a patterns of events leading to said anxious feelings you are better equipped to combat and most likely eliminate it. thus, in some people's minds anxiety is not real because it can be controlled.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have the same phobia. i don't walk or exercise in fear of an elevated heart rate and fast breathing. got my phobia after covid and several panic attacks afterwards. till date i eye any distance i have to walk and determine if i would walk it. if i can go back in time, i would go see a cardiologist first thing and do all the possible tests. once i was assured that there is nothing wrong with my heart, i would be able to start recovering doing some exposure therapy on my own or with the help of a therapist. the only way to recover from a phobia without medication is to expose yourself to the situation that makes you terrified. but gradually. over the course of few months, do activities that would raise your heart rate a little. create a graded list of activities that scare you, from walking for one minute, to running up the stairs. start slow from the least scary. do them once, twice or more until you feel that they're harmless. take someone with you who knows your condition and take a very short walk or go up few stairs. the other option is to do a fear flodding exercise. you can do a heart stress test at the clinic surrounded by experts, you would run on a treadmill and jack that heart rate to almost the maximum. once your brain sees that you've survived that, nothing else would really happen. this is part of the tests cardiologists do, takes like few minutes to complete. you might be like me fearing to go to a cardiologist, so you won't get any bad news. but it will only assure you. if there is nothing wrong with your heart, then all is well and you can gradually live your life without the fear.</data>

  <data key="d1">if you're really worried you could probably ask about always starting a beta blocker like propranolol. they're used to lower your heart rate and so kinda reduce the physical effects of anxiety with quite a low chance of side effects. i recently started taking it cos i have quite bad health and social anxiety, it honestly does wonders for me and i'm quite bad with taking medication for fear of side effects. typically though by the time i'm worried about side effects it's already slowed me down enough that i can think things through properly.</data>

  <data key="d1">have you tried medication yet? i was really hesitant in taking it too, but after i started with lexapro i remember thinking why was i so hesitant?. i had no side effects, felt pretty much like the exact same person, just calmer, and anxiety didnt hit as hard. its a subtle difference. you dont drop all your anxiety over night. i still had to put in a lot of mental work over the following year while on lexapro. ive been doing so well the last few months, that im considering going off of it. think of this every single medication youve ever taken for sicknesses or ailments, strep throat, or whatever, has side effects, but you probably didnt care too much about those, because theyre not as stigmatized.</data>

  <data key="d1">try the health anxiety sub they really helped me with the physical aspects of anxiety. having that rapid pounding heartbeat really is so scary. i dread that feeling coming back. you could look at the nutritional psychiatry sub as well. i found a lot of relief in mental health symptoms with some diet changes that arent really typical eat whole grainslow fatlean protein for health recommendations. my diet is meat, veggies, berries, saturated fat and cold pressed fruit oils i dont measure an exact amount of anything or track. most mh stuff went to remission right away the anxiety took time but its massively improved. it's something you could try if you are avoiding meds. cold water is a big one for me with the physical aspects of anxiety. dunking my face in ice water, drinking ice water, cold showers. also diaphragm breathing combined with box breathing or my face, alternate nostril breathing. i use an app called downdog and do some restorative yoga everyday when i wake up which also helps a lot. you can even do like 5 minutes and theres lots of levels so if you are very out of shape or dealing with obesity theres something there for you as well.</data>

  <data key="d1">stopped taking antidepressants due to lack of libido. i started having anxiety attacks which lead to depression and agoraphobia. got covid and that isolation led to me being suicidal. i would check my blood pressure and it was very high. lexapro didn't help me. got on cymbalta and therapy. after eight months, i now go to the gym, talk to people, drive, laugh, enjoy life, have a sex drive. a couple of days ago i drove over an hour and went to an amusement park and went on the tallest rollercoaster in the world and other rides. if you don't try you will never know and you will never progress. you get stuck. sometimes medication can do wonders.</data>

  <data key="d1">the hesitation was very real in my 3 year struggle so keep fighting medication. i fell apart at my annual physical and my doctor and i decided to give ssri's a go. i was so worried for how it would go and if it would ruin me! well, wasn't for me and transitioned to an snri. i'm in disbelief for where i'm at compared to 6 months ago, no medication listen to your body mind, but be willing to explore a bit for opportunities!</data>

  <data key="d1">if you suddenly have heart palpatations, a sense of something's wrong or danger, adrenaline rush....and there's no perceivable threat...that's generalized anxiety disorder gad. i have it it sucks. your brain puts you into the 'fight or flight' response with no threat. however, anxiety is more of a spectrum than just specific symptoms. if it continues and starts to disrupt your life, seek a good therapist to work through the root cause of the anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">all i see in your words is about fear, you fear too much. the art of life is letting go. face your fears and then... let them go away. i have a tip that works for me. consists in setting in the mind a key word or a word combination that remembers, by association, to focus on changing your mind, switching a thought, etc. for example cbm caboom c connect to a higher self and release worries on it. b breathing... remember to breathe slowly and consciously when fear or anxiety starts to get closer. m mindfulness... this remembers to pay attention to everything the senses can feel, without judging. got to stop giving too much consideration to the past. life is now. focus on the present time. this was an example i just invented.</data>

  <data key="d1">you mean nonepileptic seizures from anxiety? yea they exist but they are pretty rare in my experience and even if you do have one its just like a panic attack and itll pass even if its scary. they arent like epileptic seizures where they can cause brain damage or something as far as im aware since your brain waves stay normal during a nonepileptic seizurehence why some doctors call them pseudoseizures. youll typically notice other panic symptoms worsening way before you get to the point of having those as far as im aware.</data>

  <data key="d1">absolutely. all of my anxiety at this point in life is do to lack of money. i made a mistake at work the other day and, although i caught it and corrected it, the thought of being fired and possibly not being able to pay my rent sent me into a full panic attack after the fact. im a grown ass man and was almost in tears because the thought of not being able to provide for my family scared me so much in that moment.</data>

  <data key="d1">my parents dying has always been one of my worst fears, and my dad died of very rapid and aggressive cancer in the fall. obviously, i'd long worried about something like that happening, but there isn't really a good way to prepare for it until you realize you're actually in that situation and read up on everything you can to see what you can do to deal and what you might be in for. it sucked intensely, and i'm sure that i'll continue to miss him and be sad about it forever, but here i am on the other side. and now i only have to worry about my mom and beloved pets eventually dying, hooray... v i feel like, in some ways, having depression and anxiety as the constant background noise to my existence has made the especially bad things not hit quite as hard when they do happen. it's not like my life and emotions were all roses and then suddenly lightning struck out of a clear sky. because i'm used to having to do my best to accomplish what i can in nonideal situations and emotional states, taking care of and advocating for my dad and trying to support him and my other family members through all the negative emotions that surrounded his illness, his death, and the aftermath of his death has felt like an extension of what i'm always doing, with higher stakes.</data>

  <data key="d1">it kinda did come true, and yeah my anxiety is way lower. i still have a panic disorder, a phobia bordering on an ocd diagnosis, compulsive skin biting and picking, gad, cptsd, and autism, but ive been on the road to recovery in my unproductive habits. ive been on a routine that works for me given my financial circumstances, however money was always a massive roadblock for me. ive had multiple jobs in my life im 19 and have had to leave all of them due to reasons related to my problems suicidal from workplace bullyingburnout and extreme stress, an injury from genetic illness, etc which led me to start seeking ssi. i didnt really actually think i could get it, and i did get denied once, but i appealed with a legal aid lawyer in my area and actually got approved for a good amount of money, more than ive ever had at least. ive got a good savings and more coming in the future, im basically set for a very long time until i can get on my feet which may take a long time but at least im making money in the meantime. glad i made the decision, it has led me to do more around the house and actually focus on healing myself and building good habits.</data>

  <data key="d1">for a short time. your problem is not anxiety. your problem is seeing a threat where there is none and unintentionally creating symptoms. you can win the lottery, find god, nirvana, take the most awesome pills, read this and feel relieved by this hopefully, but as long as you are thinking about this,worried about this, above all, on the lookout for it and you are seeing this as something you need to do something about now, you will continue unintentionally feeding it. this a belief problem, a self talk problem, not an anxiety problem. anxiety is the end result. its one of the symptoms. as long as you see this as a legitimate physical problem, or as something that is caused by life anxiety, you are legitimizing it, you are suggesting it and programming that false alarm into your body. you are telling yourself that if there is anxiety in your life there will be symptoms. i could write a book about this, but not a very good one. there are plenty of people who have written very good books and have made great videos and we all say the same thing learn to leave it alone. no its not easy, but it takes more discipline than effort. effort and struggle only bring more anxiety. that grip thats on you that wont let go of you is your own grip. ityou unconsciouslywill let go of you when you let go of it. sometimes, you can manage to look away from it long enough, and then the minute you turn your back on it, it will sneak away. as long as you are looking at it, it will continue.</data>

  <data key="d1">just dont get frantic not wanting not to think about it. sometimes its good to observe it for just a moment. look at it closely and objectively, but in a detached manner, freeze frame it, i used to call it, like looking at a cockroach doing its own thing, but without letting your mind race off some place and calmly and ask yourself what is this really? nothing. its just a psychosomatic symptom. then let go. do take care of any other emotional problems to lighten the load, but dont equate the two types of anxiety, life anxiety and body anxiety. i had anxiety self induced psychosomatic symptoms for over 20 years. i hope you read all this.</data>

  <data key="d1">universal basic income would absolutely take away like 80 of my stress. i've been sick a lot for a few years, lots of time off without pay. i'm struggling to pay the bills and mortgage. we are running out of savings. if i don't start getting full paychecks we're back at the food bank soon. i'd like to say that if we had ubi i'd absolutely keep my job and work as much as i could because i love my job. i'd just have less stress about money. and money is one of my biggest stressors.</data>

  <data key="d1">the best way to reduce the physical manifestations of anxiety is to reduce your overall anxiety levels. aside from medication, deep breathing in and out your stomach, not your chest and getting plenty of exercise each day both help. i recommend anxiety workbooksjournals to help you understand and offload some of your pent up emotions. meditation or yoga are good if you can tolerate them, and apps like calm and headspace are helpful if a bit pricey, though plain old youtube videos work too. if possible, create time every day when you can unwind and get away from your stressors. maybe that's a walk in a park, a warm bath, watching tv, etc. whatever you find relaxing. these are just some of the things that help me and my anxious family members. good luck!</data>

  <data key="d1">phosphatidylserine lowers cortisol you dont need to take long term but take vitamin c and take it for maybe a day or 2 and see it wont help much with anxiety in the moment but for physical stress feelings it can help as well as kavalactones which if you take for a week you will see improvement the next week when you stop or at least i do, it seems to help with nerves, example i will go hay wire of 20 mg of caffeine like nerves light up bad, but after a week of kavalactones i can consume 200 mg of caffeine with no problems with out even taking it for up to 15 days after a week cycle. sauna and cardio will do wonders, sauna at gym is where i go before i go to hospital to stop panic attacks, can take me from twitching seizure like symptoms to being completely fine for a hour or 2 after i leave</data>

  <data key="d1">i had some issues with my heart pounding after eating during my teenage years. here's a few tips i have for you that made it stop 1. never eat too big portions. eat smaller portions spread throughout the day. when you eat too much, your stomach bloats up and presses on your lungs and hence your heart starts beating faster. 2. after eating especially bigger portions, do not lay down! remain in a seating position for the next 3060 mins, or even better, go for a little walk after eating lunch or dinner. you don't have to go outside for that, clean up the kitchen, your room, whatever it is. laying down is only causing your stomach to bloat and that can cause your heart racing. 3. drink enough water. preferably before and after eating, not during. i prefer water with bubbles sparkling, but too much of it can make your stomach bloat, too. better not to drink anything with sugars or a lot of sparkling wate etc. 4. have a yoghurt or kefir after your food. yoghurt calms down your stomach bloating. 5. breathe and don't panic. if you are still scared, get your heart checked again. however, your heart is probably fine, otherwise you would also feel it in other situations such as during sports i hope you are active? check your entire body next time if you have worries, i'd start with your stomach. because that usually use something to do with eating and digesting.</data>

  <data key="d1">then it makes sense. hard to say if all the symptoms are from that, but it most likely plays a big role or even is the sole cause. you need to start doing exercises for that. i had this problem in the past too and since i started doing the exercises, it stopped. i'd have pretty much what you listed. the worst problem was the headaches.</data>

  <data key="d1">please read its crazy how relatable your feed is to me, im 19m and it all started in december 2022, what happened for me was i was ill with some virus for like around a month or so, got better, but throughout all this time was working a stressful job and commuting and had a lot going on mentally, and one night i had my first anxiety attack, ever since then i experience what you said, that constant 247 dizziness felt like my head was moving, not visual vertigo kind of dizziness, the massive floaters in my vision and the vision problems, liek my eyes are out of focus and my head seems to go dizzy the good news is that the dizziness did go away! i promise it feels like it will last forever, looked into pppd, vestibular disorders i think these symptoms are vestibular related my dizziness lasted around a solid 34 months before it gradually turned into what it is now, where sometimes itll feel like a bit light headed and off feeling but mostly im back like 89 probably, still have the floaters but they do seem to have faded a lot compared to before, the tingling and tinnitus are things i didnt experience as much, but try that epley manoeuvre or whatever it is, might work? i did get a bit more tinnitus but ive always had a bit of tinnitus, but yeah on top of this ive had the biggest thing with health anxiety, had so many anxiety related symptoms and i do believe from god knows how much research ive spent over this that its related to anxiety and the vestibular system, not sure why or whats happened but i do know that ive improved, try vestibular rehabilitation on youtube, watch this woman called like the dizzy channel or something, she looks into it a lot, even mark cuban had it bro, its so annoying and i gave up so many times thinking it would last forever but it doesnt, took me around 34 months like i said, good diet, stick to doing physical things and moving your head around my gpdoctors never looked into it enough to get a proper answer my docs looked into my heart and stuff but all that is fine, only dealing with slight vision problems and health anxiety over now lymphoma lol was multiple sclerosis and brain tumour before because of the dizziness hoped this help and apologies for the little rant but yeha bro theres loads of people going through this and i hope that it subsides for you quickly! just give it time</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah i experience that derealisation for a while too, i believe that could be related to the anxiety around it, its like the brain is out of balance and in a state of constant fight or flight, i completely get that disorientated detached feeling, i think rehabilitation is the way to go for treating it, im not quite 100 but getting there, just give it time, the dizziness itself has pretty much fully gone for me, just the vision problems that annoy me now, eyes have all been fully scanned and everything fully looked at so its not the eye itself, i think maybe the signals from the eye to the brain are a bit scrambled, but the brain is strong and smart and learns how to overcome this so that we can be back to normal again soon</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah as annoying as it is that we cant have a 100 diagnosis and a tablet that will cure it all, we just have to deal with the fact that it will take time, and try not to scare yourself with all these stories about it lasting forever and never getting better, because i thought the same but ive slowly slowly gotten better and better to the point where im basically back to normal now despite very very minor like buzzing feeling in my head when i look at certain patterns and visually stimulating things and those floaters</data>

  <data key="d1">yes, this is self harm. it might be a good idea to talk to a trusted adult or therapist about it even if its not causing major damage right now, it could eventually, and it feels much better to have healthier coping mechanisms i also used to self harm, can confirm.</data>

  <data key="d1">so if youre in the us, your therapist legally cannot tell your parents or anyone else the contents of your therapy without your consent, unless you have intent a plan to k!ll yourself or hurt someone else. they might report self harm if it could possibly be lifethreatening but self harm is rarely something they have to tell anyone in my experience and they will try to keep confidentiality to keep your trust. im sorry your home is such a hostile environment for you, i can understand why youd be scared to tel someone. id recommend starting by telling them youre very anxious maybe find another reason like school or friendship drama if youre worried they will ask why and ask if you can start therapy. its common for minors to seek help for things they dont think they can talk to their parents about.</data>

  <data key="d1">sometimes i even think my mind makes things bigger than what they actually are, because when they calm down and go to different rooms, the day after they usually seem to be normal again. i've had a very bad moment on march, i used to feed stray cats next to my house and i used to spend time with them most of the times because i have few friends. during that period the ones i got attached to gradually started to disappear and right after the one that i cared the most about went missing my parents had that really bad fight. the next monday i had to call home from school because i was crying and banging my head over my desk in front of everyone. sorry for this sudden unasked sharing of things but i've never talked to anyone in this very details about it</data>

  <data key="d1">holy shit, ive seen a lot of posts about anxiety manifesting into physical symptoms but i have never related to one more. i have experienced all of these in the past few months as my anxiety has become more debilitating. this has resulted in several er trips and many doctor visits. like you, everything has came back within range including blood tests, xrays and a few tests done through a cardiologist. i am currently going through testing for an autoimmune disease as that did come back positive but i suspect majority if not all of my symptoms are due to anxietydepression. about a month before i started to get these physical symptoms, i remember telling my boyfriend, i really think i need to get back on meds. i wasnt feeling this bad then but shortly after it all hit me in one big swoop. i also have severe health anxiety so these symptoms scare the shit out of me and its one big vicious cycle. i feel like ive ran my brain so haywire that its just sucked all of the life out me. i feel so tired and have no energy or interest in doing things most days. i dont wake up with anticipation of doing anything anymore and find myself in bed for hours before getting up. its honestly really scary and makes me feel like my body is deteriorating. for awhile, i lost my appetite completely too. i was relying on protein shakes just to get something into my body. as for managing it, well.. i havent gotten that far yet haha. in one of my many trips to the er, i was prescribed .5 mg of lorazepam that does help immensely when i take them but im going to my pcp next week in hopes of something a little more long term than a benzo seeing as i dont have frequent panic attacks.. its more of just a chronic fight or flight mode, lol. im also thinking about therapy but it seems like a lot of therapists have went the remote route which really repels me, but i have been looking around.</data>

  <data key="d1">i totally dont blame you, i stopped taking medication probably close to 5 years ago or maybe more because i didnt like relying on it and i didnt really feel like i needed it anymore. this is the first time its kicked up in awhile and i dont think i can selfmanage on this one but i always feel like thats the best option if possible. theres definitely plenty of ways to do it i just personally havent found anything that works for me yet haha but hopefully you can. during a visit with my pcp, i was just telling her that ive felt really tired. ive always been more of a low energy person but it just felt like something has been dragging me down recently. she ordered a few blood tests like ana which can be indicative of many autoimmune diseases like lupus, sclerosis, sjrogens, etc. mine was positive and pretty high. i think most doctors will order this if you go to them about fatigue or body aches. i see a rheumatologist in about 3 weeks to do some further testing. supposedly just a positive test doesnt really mean much without any clinical findings, so it could amount to nothing or just be something that i experience years down the road.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, sorry about your situation. i can't say this or that about 2 but i know 1, as i suffer from it, too. it's called diurnal depression , and it is a symptom of depression, possibly hidden depression as in, hidden from your conscious mind, too. in my case, it has a link to anxiety, too, and can feel a lot like it. i recommend you see a physician, of course. they can provide you with real help based on your situation. that said, some things that generally may help with diurnal depression have to do with sleep hygiene and physical health. for example, 1 hour before bedtime, avoid eating things that cause peaks in your blood sugar e.g. candy, screens like the one you're reading this from blue light, and generally try to relax and calm yourself before bed. exercise regularly, and eat at somewhat even intervals throughout the day. edit as english is not my native language, i checked and verified. the term used in the englishspeaking world is actually diurnal mood variation, diurnal depression apparently being my therapist's shorthand. i suggest you google it.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes, in terms of immediate effectiveness. it is a godsend of a drug to reduce anxiety. effects are immediate and they can build up somewhat to prevent the problem. there are side effects but they are limited compared to ssris. it is much harder to exercise, so i only use it when i need it. safer on the long term, depends. your doctor obviously knows better. but if your doc has never thought about it which mind hadnt bring it up and see what they say. one thing is for absolutely certain. it is better than benzos.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey dont think that youre being dramatic, everyone reacts to things differently and one thing that might feel relaxing to one person can be extremely anxiety inducing for another. in terms of driving, please try not to let yourself feel down about failing twice, its absolutely not the end of the world! by some miracle i managed to pass first time when i did mine and i honestly think the main thing that helped me was i thought i was gonna fail. i hadnt had enough hours cancelled lessons cause i was ill and i was still ill on the day so i told myself i dont have a good chance of passing but im gonna do my best anyway. i know this is kind of a negative outlook but i think taking that i have to pass pressure away was a huge help. im so sorry to hear you have been in an accident. another big bit of advice i would give to every new driver is that if you make a mistake, just try not to panic. over time, the more hazards you encounter, the better you will be at avoiding them but the first time you see a lorry stopped on the side of the road you arent gonna instantly know what to do. these things take time and i wish you the absolute best with your driving, take care!</data>

  <data key="d1">i suffer from cardio anxiety. i dont have much advice to give, but just know your not alone. i was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism over a year ago and had every symptom that comes with ittremors, racing heart, medically induced anxiety and panic attacks. having to take a beta blocker to control my racing heart set the fear of cardio anxiety in me. i would lay awake all just thinking the medicine would cause my heart to stop beating because it would get in the low 40s. my thyroid levels have been normal for 8 months but my body only knows to stay in flight or fight mode. ive trained my body to stay ready for impact, but the impact never happens. does that make sense? i stopped wearing my apple watch a few days ago because i would symptom check all day and night. i would check for afib for anytime i have heart palpitations. i did exposure therapy on my own because i had a fear of physical activity and scared of anything that would cause my heart to race. i faced my fear by going on daily walks from 30 mins to an hour. realizing that i didnt die from a heart attack after my heart rate got into the 120s. i do have to say that i had a panic attack on one of my walks because i was symptom checking heart rate and noticed my rate getting to 130s and totally freaked myself out and heart rate got to 150 i quit walking altogether. but when i was walking i felt my best!!! so i need to get back out there and do exposure therapy again. im also in weekly therapy doing health emdr and childhood emdr. not sure if its working, but ill try anything right now other than medication which im getting desperate and thinking about being medicated for this health anxiety. i know how you feel 1000. not sure if you are religious or not, but prayers and listening to christian music helps me. also, i have a mindfulness app that i listen to every morning and sometimes at night when my brain wont turn off.</data>

  <data key="d1">i came on to this sub because i feel similar symptoms sometimes. when i feel like a panic attack is coming on i start to feel like im on a boat or the ground is moving beneath me. i wanted to know if anybody else felt the same way. i also am experiencing more headaches as well. sometimes i wonder if our brain picks up on something like a physical symptom and almost replays it as a way to signal stress? im not sure im explain it right however.. but, ive passed out before so now i feel my body shows me the signs of fainting as a stress trigger more often than it ever did prior to that experience. if that is any food for thought? i wish i had a better ideas of around helping it as im seeking some remedies myself. but i notice it happens more often on days where i may have spaced my meals too far apart. ive tried upping my food intake and electrolytes as well as sitting down when i start to feel dizzy. for me the dizziness also starts panic attacks so i try to place relaxing music or rain sounds in my headphones and go outside to get fresh air. i also try to do a light exercise stretch or walks on days i feel ok to remind myself that im an overall average healthy person beyond these feelings.. i hope this helps a little if at all. i feel my symptoms may be more anxiety based though. but, just know youre not alone and i hope it all gets better for you. sorry its so long</data>

  <data key="d1">i believe what really works is, eating healthy. do get lots of fruits and vegetables, and drink at lest 5 bottles of water a day. also, add fish to your diet, cook your food instead of buying out and fast sometimes if you can. it resets your stomach gut, and it's a healing process. if you like you can watch youtube videos on how fasting helps with anxiety you will learn a lot. but please stay away from processed foods, they put lots of chemicals in that stuff that isint good for the brain. for example, subway, mcdonald's, frozen pizza from grocery stores and several other restaurants. add vitamins and fish oils, b12 and get some exercise and great sleep and limit stress. i hope and i believe this will make a difference, try this for at lest 2 months. i guarantee you you will see a change</data>

  <data key="d1">youre original post made me think of the truman show as that also made me question our existence. i then checked your posts to see if there was anything about it and it was the first thing i saw. after watching it i was extremely paranoid that there was cameras in my room and always blocked the camera on my phone. what you fear is something that many people fear. i cant just tell you over reddit that what you fear isnt real and that no one is controlling us because you wont believe me. seeing a psychologist should be your number one priority right now. its very draining to feel how you are but its definitely something you can defeat and overcome. im sorry you have to deal with this and im sorry i couldnt be much help to you. it might also help to know that youre not the only one feeling the way you do. many people have developed whats known as truman syndrome from watching the truman show.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah dont worry i know youre real. i would recommend finding another psychologist though. it took me a few trys to find the right one but once i did it was life changing. that psychologist sounds like he just wanted quick money. it usually takes a psychologist a few sessions before they put you on medication because they will usually try and treat it with psychology first. i beat anxiety without medication and with psychology. i know it probably costs a lot of money but its definitely worth it.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think the connection is fabricated by your brain. acknowledge that it makes no sense and that your brain is creating this based on one time that it happened. try watching parts of movies on youtube instead of the entire movie, but do it in a relaxed state, eat some snacks and just play it in the background. try this as exposure therapy until your brain gives up on trying to establish this as a threat.</data>

  <data key="d1">it wouldn't block or reduce the release of adrenaline, it just will just reduce your heart rate and make you feel calmer while still experiencing the other affects of adrenaline. do you have low level constant anxiety, have occasional panic attacks, or both? i manage my low level anxietydepression with zoloft and wellbutrin and metoprolol at night to help me sleep. that combo keeps it at bay for the most part but i have emergency ativan if i get a panic attack.</data>

  <data key="d1">i dont particularly have advice which i apologize for, but i think this is fairly common for people who are prone to anxiety or have an anxiety condition. moving, getting a new job or quitting one, starting new relationships, transitions in school, death of a loved one, etc,. are all fairly stressful events for people who dont struggle with anxiety. ive helped friends move who didnt struggle with anxiety and i could almost feel the stress radiating off them, so moving and big life changes are not pleasant for anyone. the feelings of stress can definitely turn into anxiety, and from there it can take over. ive experienced several big bouts of anxiety throughout the years and almost all of them were all an after effect of a big life change. things settle down after a while, and it will likely happen again, but the good news in my opinion is every time you have a struggle it gives you tools to deal with it the next time.</data>

  <data key="d1">it sounds to me like you're having an existential crisis or existential dread. it's pretty common where people question the meaning of their lives or what happens when they die or anything else really relating to existence. it sounds like your existential dread goes hand and hand with your anxiety though, so if you address one you're likely to address the other to some degree as well. i'd suggest seeing a therapist, but maybe reading and learning about existentialism and coping mechanisms for anxiety might be beneficial as well.</data>

  <data key="d1">1. have you tried emailing anxiety specialists around the country? experienced doctors will probably have the right treatment for you, it may be some sort of anxiety medication or just for vomiting 2. it is completely okay to have a weakness like this, if you partner doesn't accept this feature of yours, then they're definitely the wrong person and they should leave for good, you shouldn't feel rejected. i mean, even blinddeafamputated and other types of people with big problems find love, meanwhile, you're worried about the occasional vomiting. i'd ask you to let your date know early on about this insecurity. if they reject you, just don't be bogged down, move onto next date because they're not right. you'll find someone i promise.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey there, i read your post and i felt every single word. i've always been anxious about almost everything, and this is something i'm realising in the last years. it's like i've always convinced myself that this is normal and that i just have to deal with it. things got even harder when i started blaming myself for how i feel. it all starts with one comment or one thought. then it is all question after question. is it my fault? did i do something wrong? do all the people think everything i do is wrong? am i even capable of doing something or am i just a fraud? and all these questions escalate so quickly. i'm feeling exactly as you said, my mind is basically sabotaging me. i'm constantly trying to process these thoughts and find the reason for them to pop up in mind, but as you said, it's a spiral. and it is all ups and downs. at times i manage to calm myself down by telling myself that this is all in my mind and that i will be able to work on it, at others, it is just so hard i get stuck and i don't know what to do. it is so tremendously overwhelming that it becomes toxic. i believe that the fact that you're talking about this is very positive thing. it shows that you really want to feel better and find solutions. and this is something i'm trying to tell to myself as well. it took me years to stand in front of myself and say i want to be ok and i deserve to be ok. because everyone deserves to feel good and happy. i often feel sad when i realise that i'm being my worst enemy, while i should be the person i love and take care of the most. i really hope you will feel better after your doctor appointment. i have also scheduled an appointment with a therapist this week and this will be my first time. it's something i've wanted to do in the last 23 years probably, but even in this case, i just kept overthinking it for a very long time. i know how difficult all of this is, and i hope that you will manage to find a way to feel better. you are not alone, and you do deserve happiness. and you need to remind yourself this often. it is extremely difficult, frightening and painful sometimes, but remember that things can go better than this. even if it can be extremely hard to believe when feeling lost. i hope you manage to find your way to stay positive and work on this, and don't forget that you really deserve it!</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you so much for your response and im glad my post resonated with you! i often feel alone and like its only me that feels this way, which in turn makes me feel crazy, so it is comforting to see how many other people also experience these thought patterns. i hope therapy goes well for you, even if it doesnt initially, you can always find another and you can always work on getting better in different ways. and i agree it is difficult to get help isnt it, because youre constantly telling yourself that you are not deserving of it, so it is a positive thing that we can recognise our awful thought processes, and realise that we do deserve to be happy and not feel so bad about ourselves all the time. it is very, very difficult and i spiral at the most ridiculous things to the point i feel nauseous. i used to just call myself sensitive and emotional, and maybe i am both of those things, but they dont make me a bad person. i just struggle to react in an appropriate way when these thoughts and feelings overwhelm me, and i do often take it out on people. i always, always apologise and i always explain and break down how my mind works and exactly why i was upset by a comment someone has made, but it is hard for people to understand when they dont have to deal with this. and i also have to understand that its not anyones fault that they dont understand. understanding ourselves is the most important thing, so we can learn and get better and help ourselves to deal with these things. would just be a bonus if people could be in my shoes sometimes and realise why i sometimes work the way i do.</data>

  <data key="d1">oh dude! not only it resonates with me, it's basically like i'm listening to myself. i totally understand the sense of feeling alone in this sometimes. it is just so difficult to explain these thought patterns to someone. it's like trying to explain to someone how a complicated machine works, while you're still learning yourself. the entire process is something that requires a lot of work and patience. i've always found it difficult to reach out for help for this, due to the exact reason you said i know i'm very sensitive and emotional. so i think well, i'm just being sensitive and emotional, do i really need help? or do i just need to be stronger and learn how to deal with this?, and this is a constant loop. i sometimes even joke about this when i realise that a particular circle of thoughts started from the smallest ridiculous thing. still, this can also be overwhelming and energy draining and it can escalate to major anxious thoughts very quickly. i also take it out on people sometimes and this is one of the things i hate the most. even if i'm not doing anything bad, it just can significantly affect a relationship with someone. i'm trying to process my thoughts as much as possible in order to be able to present them in the correct way. you said a very important thing, that we also have to understand people around us and that it is not their fault if they don't understand us entirely. the problem is when all of this gets more severe, i sometimes feel stuck in my head and i find it very difficult to share what i'm feeling in that exact moment. it is like total chaos. thinking about everything and nothing at the same time. one thing that has helped me through my entire life is music. i live with it and it's a kind of a safe place for me. there is a specific song i would like to share with you, it came to my mind when i wrote that this is a constant loop. i don't know if you will like it, but i'm pretty sure you will resonate with the lyrics. i will leave it below in case you want to check it out!</data>

  <data key="d1">i get anxiety about having to use a public restroom. partially bc of cleanliness like idk what the bathroom will look like, and partially the anxiety of people seeing me go to the bathroom and walk inout. sometimes i worry if i eat a big meal i cant go out because what if ill have to go crap? what if i have diarrhea? one reason i hate flying because i end up dehydrated because i dont drink enough for fear of using the airplane bathroom.</data>

  <data key="d1">ugh, i know the feeling. i had an anxiety attack when i went to go see melanie martinez. when i looked around after i had sat down, i realized i was surrounded by people i have a fear of crowds. and i spiraled into dissociation and started to feel extremely nauseous. i am also afraid of throwing up, so that didn't help, and i was afraid i wouldn't be able to escape the crowd to get to the bathroom. it sucks and i'm sorry you went through that.</data>

  <data key="d1">i take propranolol for my panic disorder and its been really great!! no noticeable side effects and i believe its fine to take as needed with no weaning! i take mine daily so this is based off what ive read for me personally if i took it daily for a week or two i would slowly wean off just to be extra cautious but i dont think its necessary! i hope it helps you! its such a great tool</data>

  <data key="d1">i take it occasionally. no weaning anything like that. i find it's most helpful for countering the physical symptoms of panic, if not the emotional side. it really doesn't go well with alcohol i know this is true of almost all anxiety and depression meds, but for some reason combining these two makes me feel very bad. it can also worsen my asthma symptoms, but my asthma is pretty mild.</data>

  <data key="d1">it works a treat, eradicates shaky hands, shaky voice, labored breathing, on the down side, i find it can make sweating really bad, have noticed this in job interviews, highly stressful environments, and it can lower blood pressure, so walking can feel a bit weird, like your going slower than normal, and yea dont excercise on it, you may still feel the anxious thoughts, though your body wont react with the shakes etc so it cuts that anxiety feeder loop, were then you become anxious because people can see your hands shaking etc. probably the best non addictive med there is for anxiety in my mind</data>

  <data key="d1">i agree on the sweating! however i'll go to the gym after 20mg, maybe 3 hours later, no issues. i find actually i can sometimes run better without my heart overracing. i have a tenancy to get heart palpitations when exercising hard which is scary af and propranolol prevents that. basically makes it impossible to go over 130bpm lol</data>

  <data key="d1">also, to add for the op. i got better results when i took it every day, 20mg at 8am and 20mg at around 1pm after the gym at lunch. blocks all panic for me which then helps me stop thinking it's gonna happen, which also stops it from happening. i found having it in my pocket for emergencies only was like another burden to think about. what if i need help right away and it takes an hour to kick in? type thoughts. i have a job where i could get asked any moment to speak to a group or something, i'd rather just already be ready. if that makes sense</data>

  <data key="d1">propranolol gave me some weird side effects and made me act really out of character when i tried to quit... i took it onoff when needed for 2 weeks, maybe 5 pills in total? it calmed me down at first but then i started to have really weird sad thoughts and felt lethargic so i stopped taking it. i remember a few days after i stopped i felt great then suddenly my heart rate randomly spiked to around 150bpm in the middle of the night and didn't stop for 48hours. the entire time i felt like pulling my own skin off like i was trapped in my own body. none of these things are even listed as side effects so that shows how untested it is for anxiety use.</data>

  <data key="d1">hello! first, i hope you can get some good sleep soon. being sleep deprived sucks. second, yes, i unfortunately have a lot of experience with intrusive and suicidal thoughts. my best advice is to find something that is all consuming. whether it is reading a book, working out, running, playing a hard video game, writing an essay, or whatever youre interested in, find something that requires the entirety of your mental energy. this is what i do when i start ruminating or having intrusive thoughts, as it leaves no room for the voice to intrude. third, and most important, do not do anything rash. it is important that you acknowledge that the thoughts are running counter to your desires. keep that in the forefront of your mind when dealing with them. if none of that works for you and you continue having issues sleepingdealing with the intrusive thoughts, dont hesitate to seek professional help. i can only tell you what has worked for me! i hope it helps you even a little bit.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi, i recovered from this. it's crucial to not seek reassurance about how you don't want to do it, because doing it is feeding these thoughts and it makes them come back again and again. the best way is to simply let the thoughts play out and not engage them. do remember to not seek any reassurance. and don't worry about possibly doing it, intrusive thoughts never turn into action.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know how you feel all too well. i had these thoughts for a long time, and they still creep up from time to time. what helped me is medication and therapy, but most importantly, acknowledging and understanding when my brain is telling me, god im so stupid i want to kill myself, what that really means is, god im so tired of feeling so anxious, down, and depressed all the time i need to be more proactive in addressing it. for me that meant therapy and medication, but for someone else it could mean i need to spend more time outside, socializing, eat healthier and exercise, etc. even with therapy and healthier habits, i still have the thoughts creep up from time to time. i try to acknowledge that these thoughts exist, and they will likely exist in some form or fashion in the future. so when they creep up, i acknowledge them, but assure myself that these are just passing clouds, so i try to focus on the blue sky above them. every storm runs out of rain, as maya angelou said.</data>

  <data key="d1">personally, i think it's important to talk to your doctor about being unable to sleep. you don't have to mention your intrusive thoughts to them... that being said, i will always recommend talking to a professional, be it a md or a therapist about your thoughts so that you can work through them properly. they are the best equipped to help you and people on the internet can only do so much. on the topic of intrusive thoughts. i've had them forever. i guess some people don't? i have them randomly, sometimes it's i could crash head on into traffic while driving or what if i jumped? when i'm in a high place. i think it's important to acknowledge that those aren't serious considerations in your head. they're just your brain communicating to you how much danger you're in and that you need to be careful. basically, if you are having frequent intrusive thoughts it could be your brain trying to tell you something important. i hope you find sleep soon!</data>

  <data key="d1">i have actually gone through it and its actually my most prominent ocd theme rn, i will say that reassuring u by saying ah dont worry u wont do it only makes the thoughts worse so i wont twll u that. but i will say that im ok, i got diagnosed with ocd in march and since then ive learned about erp and thats helped a little, at least in the sense that im aware of when my thoughts are intrusive for the most part. what ive learned to say in response to the thoughts is sure maybe idk but i dont want to make things seem pucture perfect. on my worst days i do fall into a compulsiveanxious cycle and really freak out because im scared i will actually do something to myself this is my main reason for considering meds. if i were you id 1. first look into erp and ocd for research purposes and to see if u relate to anything. 2. see if u can find and erp trained therapist, if not try some excercises on ur own. 3. let someone who u trust know that ur going through this just so u have physical support, and 4. monitor your anxiety, if u see little improvement def consider meds! i hope things work out and if anything u can message me!</data>

  <data key="d1">it will be good to just make sure everything is physically fine, however remember that there is a probable mental element. in my case i think i know what triggered this period of anxiety but it has prolonged itself by the other issues that it can latch on to. so even though my head may feel fine at a given moment, there is a reason bouts of anxiety are being triggered that manifest themselves physically. for that reason i am now seeking a referral for counselling and i would recommend you consider the same or at least talk about it with your doctor, though of course your country may do things differently or charge you. also im not sure exactly what the medical options are for controlling hormones, the medication i was put on is propranolol which does not do that but its really for your doctor to look at.</data>

  <data key="d1">guy here. just a hunch but it sounds like youre doing this all a little too soon. ive been there before. and its super annoying to hear take time to work on yourself and all the cliches with it. but you dont have to rush. being newly single is a time for self discovery, self love, new experiences, and maintenance. you may not feel that heartbroken, but it still affects you. it will for a little while. but it goes away. just be safe and enjoy time with your friends</data>

  <data key="d1">i know but after my last relationship i was back out there straight away which is why im so confused, and i felt zero guilt whatsoever. i know i dont have any need to feel guilt this time either but i do. at least the last relationship i was in when i did this and felt no guilt, the guy still loved me. in this one, my partner doesnt even love me or care for me anymore, so why do i still feel guilty? i am working on myself and im feeling better but in terms of the break up im sick of this anxiety. thank you so much for the advice</data>

  <data key="d1">i know exactly how you feel. been in that situation. i struggle with general anxiety and abandonment issues. dating for me was almost like a science experiment. just dont obsess over what you did wrong or what you could have done better. youre likely just trying to wrap your head around how someone could be so cold when youre probably a really good catch. hope you feel better soon!</data>

  <data key="d1">ive had health anxiety on and off since i was about 15? it can be terrifying and extremely stressful. the anxiety will mimic symptoms from whatever you are worrying about. chest pain, dizziness are a pretty common anxiety symptom, ive had them myself. i was scared i had a brain tumor for a few weeks, and i had balance issues, headaches, vision issues. but once i went to the doctor and was reassured, the symptoms all vanished. im 18 now and have been having health anxiety about having cardiac arrest, and i know its dumb to even think that at my age and health. anyway, if youve been tested, and nobody is concerned, you are okay. i know its hard to believe. we are both way too young to be worried about heart attacks and cardiac arrest. anyway i hope you can get over this, hopefully i helped just a bit. hope you kick the anxietys ass.</data>

  <data key="d1">setting boundaries is so important in order for you to take care of yourself and to maintain good relationships. if someone is bringing a lot of drama into yourself consider whether you need to distance yourself from them. i know that can be very difficult, particularly with family. make sure you have enough you time, doing the thing you like and that bring you peace and happiness. remind yourself that while empathy is good, taking on someone else's stress helps no one.</data>

  <data key="d1">im an empath and im sorry youre dealing with this!! its constant for me. i think a big thing is actively choosing to keep bad energy away from you in the moment mentally stay focused on yourself and good things for you but i know its really not easy. i also wear certain stones to help with that. another thing ive done is just put up boundaries you know? not letting certain people into my life as much or limiting contact as much as possible with people who affect me negatively. good luck</data>

  <data key="d1">i guess, in the way that time is passing by and i could do so much during that time, but i just can't. in a more practical sense, i very often think jesus christ, there's this coming, and then that, and another thing then... not in a burnout kind of way because i know what that looks like, but rather in a way that makes me feel that there's always an upcoming stressful event, preventing me from relaxing. for example, right now, i've got nothing but free time for weeks, and yet, i feel tense about a thing that's coming, even though i know that this thing doesn't actually exist. that's a bit long but that's the gist of it, thanks for asking</data>

  <data key="d1">my mother is... complicated. she's aware of how social anxiety works, and my therapist has done her best to explain it, my mother just has this weird philosophy of if i'm inconvenienced, it's only fair that everyone else is so if she has a bad day at work she'll scream at me, if i'm not available to help her with something she'll get verbally aggressive, and when she has a day off, she'll occasionally pull a stunt like this to make up for the rest of the week it's messed up, i know it is, she knows it is, but unfortunately she doesn't really care... chances are if it'll make her feel better about something, she'll do it</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. picking at the skin, including the lips, can be a coping mechanism for some people, especially during times of stress or anxiety. however, when it becomes severe and leads to bleeding and pain, it's essential to seek support and help. you are not alone in this struggle, and many people experience similar urges to pick at their skin. it's crucial to reach out to a healthcare professional or therapist who can provide guidance and support in managing these urges and finding healthier coping mechanisms. remember, seeking help is a sign of strength and selfcompassion. you deserve to feel better and find ways to take care of yourself. take that courageous step towards getting the support you need. sending you lots of love and encouragement on your journey to healing and wellbeing.</data>

  <data key="d1">if thats not you then dont do it, theres nothing wrong with it or weird. getting with someone who loves going out when you love staying in is isnt a good idea either. you were polar opposites so it wasnt going to work regardless. as to right now its distraction and avoiding the emotions with alcohol and friends, the latter is fine but the former is a gateway to alcoholism. find other ways to distract yourself other then doing something you dont wanna do and something that will harm you in the long term.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi, this doesn't sound like a typical eating disorder, which is from obsessions. did you try cutting off carbs for a while? i did that on my doctor's recommendation. aparently it gives the stomach a break to regenarate and the progress stays after you get back on carbs. for me this started working only like 2 days in and it completely stopped my nausea from anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">its very nice of you to want to support this coworker! the anxiety makes one feel even more embarrassed its a never ending cycle. do you know anything this person likes snacks, drinks, etc.? they may feel more embarrassed or uncomfortable if you bring it up again so it might be nice to maybe just leave them something they like with a little note that says you hope they have a great day. its really hard to know how to respond to somebody with anxiety because not everybody responds or reacts the same way. you could let a week or so pass and then ask this person how they would like you to respond in that situation if you encounter it again. they may not know when thats ok. they may not want to talk about it and that is ok as well. thank you for trying to help somebody get through the weeds!</data>

  <data key="d1">some good advice from other posters, particularly the advice of making sure you treat them normally. as a manager though it is worth looking at what support your business offers. no idea what country you are in but some of the things may include for example reasonable adjustment plan stress management plan employee assistance program these tools can assist your employee in managing their anxiety and provide tools to you and them to help deal with these attacks. obviously it is down to them whether they want to use them and what they are comfortable telling you. but at the very least i would suggest finding out what is available and signposting them to your employee, so that they can come to you to discuss if needed.</data>

  <data key="d1">awesome your asking a couple thoughts as suffer who refuses to tell his work and fake it through panic attacks 1. in the moment just be their for them. its a flight or fight response. doing breathing with them. slow like 5in hold for 5, then count to ten for the 10outbreath use your lips to slow it. 1a. ask them if they have any rescue medication do they need it can you get it for them ? 2. distraction can really help. just talk to them about small stuff, do they have a hobby, new tv show or movie. just start chatting to get them to stop thinking their chest and face are about to explode 3. once through the crisis. let them know its ok. as a boss you are hear to support them. 4. follow up and check in with them. share what services the company offers. tell the person anytime if she has a panic crisis at work shehe can call you for support. 5. keep it confidential. its a health issue so super important. probably tell hr get their advice but really its not to be shared even with your boss unless it is absolutely necessary.</data>

  <data key="d1">thats super difficult. i have adhd anxiety and an employer. i had a very smart young woman as a staff person as an office manager. she struggled with what were obviously severe adhd symptoms and the anxiety that comes with it. she hadnt been diagnoses with either and it was impacting her performance. i tried to talk with her but felt like i had to be careful not to invade her privacy about a medical condition that she did not bring to me herself. even in our relaxed environment and telling her she wasnt in trouble because i saw how hard she was trying and she may struggle with certain tasks, she wouldnt talk about it. it was hard to navigate because she was getting nothing done and making a lot of mistakes. at one point i told her that sometimes staff members have health issues that impact their performance and once they told me, i was able to accommodate it as a disability and couldnt discriminate against them. still no luck. i decided to take a risk and take her out to lunch and asked her how her job was, told her the performance issues that sounded coincidentally like a symptoms list, asked her if she thought about getting assessed for adhd, and told her i was curious because i had adhd and thought there might be ways to make her job easier and less stressful. nothing at all was punitive and i stressed that i wasnt interested in firing her or even writing her up but that we needed to work together to get her performance up or she needed to come back with a plan. unfortunately, she immediately got defensive and offended. it really sucked because i could relate. she ended up being layed off at the end of a contract and a full 2 years later she called me up to tell me she was diagnosed, medicated and had a cbt therapist helping her. i took that as a thank you but she said nothing about how pissed she was or that i was right. being a progressive and aware employer can be tricky especially with staff who have a cognitive or mental health condition. there is so much stigma and real consequences that people come to us already afraid to talk about what is going on with them, diagnosed or not. not quite the same situari</data>

  <data key="d1">so just curious, when you have a panic attack like that do you or presumably someone in your shoes view an outsider coming in as insensitive if we were trying to talktake your attention off whatever initiated the attack like your boss did? that was my concern which is why i ultimately didnt say much. obviously every person is different and may want an outsider to react differently, but i would love to hear your thoughts on that.</data>

  <data key="d1">ummm no, it wasnt. the english language has used theythem pronouns to describe a single unknown person since well the english language. for example, some one might tell a friend, i have a new doctor, to which the friend would reply, oh, how are they? did the first person mention a team of doctors? no, they didnt, just like i didnt mention either of the two friends genders, so they are both they. now, 40 years ago, you might get looked at a little funny for being too politically correct, whatever that means, because masculine pronouns were used as the understood or preferred gender. but that was also about the same time we started seeing dramatic shifts in commonuse words like policeman, fireman, mailman turn to police officer, fire fighter, and letter carrier because its not the 1920s and women can work now. vote even. what im saying is, if youre gonna troll, at least be a good one.</data>

  <data key="d1">is there any possibility for you to get the blood from your hand. i guess we can't compare, i am pretty afraid of needles i just really hate it. i even think about the procedure days before they test my blood every few hours, and can't get it out of my mind. a few months ago a nurse took the first time blood from my hand and it was 100x better for me and my anxiety, it just felt so much different. my hand was slightly swollen the last few times but a few days and i was alright.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey grizzly, just to say i used to have an absolute awful fear of needles too, i used to burst into tears when i had to get vaccines as a teen when everyone else just 'got on with it'. i've not had an experience like the one as you mentioned seriously, i'm really really sorry you had to go through that but i feel like i can understand a little of the anxiety associated with needles. i'm not sure what to suggest as an alternative, is it possible you could see a different physician who might be more receptive to how this makes you feel, and how it makes your arm react? i also wonder if you might benefit from cbt or exposure therapy where it might help you densentise you to needles. that might sound really awful but i did something similar for a fear of mine and it actually helped, i was able have a procedure successfully after two failed and really upsetting attempts.</data>

  <data key="d1">i had this exact same experience panic attack, convinced of a heart attack, then fixated on some underlying heart condition. t he thing is, the more you focus on a certain part of your body in this case your heart the more you will notice sensations and twinges that are always there but you don't pay any attention to them. if i ask you now to focus solely on your left foot for 3 minutes you will no doubt start to feel sensations you normally would pay no attention to. similarly, clearly you are repeatedly taking your blood pressure reading for reassurance but you're only continuing this pattern of anxiety. blood pressure naturally fluctuates throughout the day and it will rise if you're feeling anxious. please try to stop researching and testing your blood pressure. you went to the er, had the necessary tests to rule anything serious out and you are still here 4 days later. you are absolutely fine x</data>

  <data key="d1">my anxiety was also triggered by a health scare which left me in an awful anxiety loop. every single symptom you listed can be a symptom of anxiety, the mind is very powerful. i get chest pain and nausea when im anxious, sometimes i feel like i have a full out virus or something. i promise it will get better! i extend my thoughts, know that theres a whole bunch of people who feel the exact same way. it is just merely sensations, you are healthy! if possible i would recommend speaking to a psychiatrist or therapist, just because that might nip it in the bud before it can blossom into a full on phobia.</data>

  <data key="d1">focus on the fact all your tests came back fine. i can't take preworkout anymore because i now have reactions to it, and i have to be super careful with my overall caffeine intake. i had a similar situation to you a few years ago, i went so far as to make an appointment with a cardiologist, who all but laughed me out of his office he didn't really, he was very kind. up until that appointment i had been obsessing over my heart rate, so i ended up taking my garmin off for the three weeks leading up to the appointment. and even to this day i have a watch face that doesn't show my heart rate. you'll be ok. give yourself some grace and a bit to recover. panic attacks can take a lot out of you. it never hurts to look into seeing a therapist though. therapy is never a bad idea.</data>

  <data key="d1">been there where you are multiple times! and once you have the anxiety attack and are back to somewhat normal you are constantly looking over your shoulder waiting anxiously for the next crushing crisis to happen. which then gives you anxiety. i got myself in a tizzy so bad that my blood pressure was 178107 a few times. i just started to read the book dare. great read and i find it super helpful. take all off the extras out if your routine. no more preworkout stuff, lay off any caffeine, soda. just do your best to chill. i know easier said than done and like technicaladvice9227 said above each day you will start to gain your confidence back, your normal will slowly come back and you will be confident that it was just anxiety and not a heart attack.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know it's scary as hell. one thing that really helps me with this is doing like 15 mins of restorative yoga when i wake up. i use the downdog app and honestly do it on the easiest setting it's not my workout it's just to help me start the day. its insanely relaxing and it helps you stretch your body so if you're anxious when you're sleeping and clenching your jaw or body and not realizing it you get these awful pains that you start to focus on and obsess over and just the light relaxing stretching when you wake up can totally change the game. because you're not as tense you dont get the full or stabbing pains and it helps calm the health anxiety. i find if i dont do it more than 3 or 4 days in a row it starts to come back but it's been an amazing help. in general other things that have helped with my anxiety are a sleep scheduale, low carb and no processed food as well as exercise. if you lift a lot of weights you may frown at the idea of limiting carbs but ketogains exists! i did it to manage diabetes but it ended up a bigger boon to my mental health. i hope i gave you some ideas that help you out!</data>

  <data key="d1">a panic attack will present with the exact same symptoms as a heart attack. the only difference between a panic attack and a heart attack is the way any pain will present themselves. the symptoms of panic come in waves and come and go, a heart attack never comes and goes it will just build and build in a constant fashion. i never knew about this until it happened to me too. first thing you need to do is understand that you will feel scared, this is a natural response to a scary experience. it will get better if you let it.</data>

  <data key="d1">for me, after 4 years of constant panic attacks, after therapy, exposure therapy, meditation, natural remedies, etc, the only thing that was able to put me back to normal was antidepressants. i had a similar health anxiety reaction with my heart after a trip to ae. i was only 17, reacted badly to a painkiller, and it sent me into tachycardia. after that fun experience, i ended up checking my heart all the time my pulse, whether my heart was beating anymore, i'd have panic attacks, cried every time i heard my pulse on a heart monitor, etc. i go to the gym all the time too and i'm in perfect health! it's normal to feel terrified after an experience like that. what helped me was telling myself that it's just a feeling. it sounds basic, but.. unfortunately, that's all that there is to it. if the anxiety gets too bad, and you are unable to move on, i recommend speaking to a doctor.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have felt this way before. it helps me to use reasoning. the most helpful thing i was told from a doctor was that heart attacks and strokes come from years of untreated high blood pressure. also after working in health care for the past few years. i used to think 13090 or 14090 was scary. it's actually pretty common when you're nervous and checking your blood pressure. if you're taking it, and it's 13090, then you wait a few moments and take it again, and it's normal, it was most likely high due to anxiety. i am completely comfortable with those blood pressures! also, ekgs and blood work would give them a warning that you are going to haveor had a cardiac event. if they said it looks good, they didn't notice any heart blocks or anything suspicious. they wouldn't lie to you, or sugar coat the truth! so it's a win, you know your heart is looking good! i hope this helps</data>

  <data key="d1">man i literally had something very similar happen to me in february of this year i had two massive panic attacks both of which i was convinced i was dying of a heart attack. i called 911 and the ambulance came both times. some of the scariest moments of my life. it turned out to be just severe anxiety and panic. but the body remembers this stuff and its easy to get stuck in this loop of fear. just remember to take it slow, one day at a time. youll have good and bad days.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have had a similar experience. i also have sleep apnea which makes the fear more stronger. but nothing is wrong with my body and i should just think logically. i had my heart scanned and it helped me so much. don't be scared to exercise because it helps with the anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">this sounds very much like my first ever panic attack back in 2010. i also went to the er thinking that there was something wrong with me, only to be told every test was normal and given a handful of valium to take home. so began my anxiety journey.</data>

  <data key="d1">panic and anxiety attacks feed on the fear of another one. ive had the same fears you have for many years and when i look back now, all i can think is how much time i wasted being scared. you got a clean bill of health! let your mind focus on that. with time, the fear will fade. you went through a scary experience that is going to take a minute to stop obsessing over.</data>

  <data key="d1">i had about 20 sessions. i didn't find it helpful at all. i just went because it was free for me lol and had tons of free time during that time. i educated myself on anxiety great deal and i'm confident in saying there isn't really anything therapy can do besides explaining to you erpexposure therapy. and that's very simple, you can easilly do that by yourself. and then you need to keep praciticing it towards your fears. but a therapist cannot help you with that, that's all on you from that point. so that's why i don't see anything a therapist can do for someone with anxiety. and judging by other posts from here, so many people have this experience.</data>

  <data key="d1">therapists are like doctors, lawyers, managers, etc. there are good ones and bad ones and meh ones. i'm middleaged. my therapist identified my anxiety on, like, my first visit with her. and she said we'll dig into what's going on and see if we can figure this out. my therapist is amazing. it also helped that i had a panic attack about two months later, unrelated to therapy, and had my first dose of hydroxyzine. it allowed me to feel what a normal reaction is to an unexpected event. from there, i've been able to kind of baseline how my reactions should be. if you can nail down the sources, anxiety can go away, or at least be seriously muted. i still have periods of anxiety. it happens. but it's not the constant, keyed up state i always seemed to be in. i also tell my family what's going on in my head. we were at the airport recently. based on a prior encounter, i stopped them and said okay, we're reaching the point where i don't have any more information that you all, so if you ask me a question, my response will be 'i don't know.' that set the expectation so i didn't get all anxious. and we started looking for people to help us. i'm not a mental health professional, just a patient. it may technically be true that anxiety doesn't go away, but for me, deadening the anxiety reaction to almost nothing is as good as it going away.</data>

  <data key="d1">unfortunately, anxiety isnt something that will just go away one day. sure, it can get better. but viewing it as something you can be cured from will do more harm than good. ive been in therapy for about 10 years now and have changed therapists several times. its quite possible the one you saw wasnt the right fit for you, and theres nothing wrong with that. therapy can be wonderfully beneficial with the right therapist. i will admit though, that even with my current therapist if 4 years, i have sessions that i dont view or feel as beneficial. but sessions build upon each other and it all is working towards a bigger picture reducing anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think it depends where your anxiety comes from. if your anxiety is based on beliefs formed by past trauma, a good therapist can help you process the traumatic experiences. personally, my therapist has given me lots of tools for combating my anxiety. i used to rate super high on the gad7 and now i barely have anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">sure, you can continue drinking and blacking out, making a drunken fool of yourself and destroying your relationships with family and friends. soo, you want to go on drinking until you're told it's a choice between drinking and death? so what you want is to get able to continue drinking but without the consequences of blackouts, upset friends family is that right? good luck with that. let me know if you ever figure out a way.</data>

  <data key="d1">an almost mistake doesn't count as a mistake. you caught it. ergo, it's not a mistake, it's a win for checking yourself. so you made one mistake, in an environment that you say was much busier than normal. did everyone get their orders? were they satisfied? even the one where you had the mistake said it was okay. so, congratulations! you had a bunch of happy customers! and i mean that genuinely, not flippantly. let's say you handled n orders tonight. 1 had a mistake. why focus on that instead of the n1 that didn't have mistakes? life has mistakes. you're not a machine. you're allowed to make mistakes. cut yourself some slack. today was a job well done. go back to your next shift with your head high, ready to do good work. and if you make a mistake, apologize and move on.</data>

  <data key="d1">fixing this is not fast. it has taken a lot, triggered from unexpected places, to get this under control for me. don't expect to fix this overnight, but you can fix it. it'll take time. long ago, i worked for a hospital department that, among other things, coordinated inbound patient transfers. i got the bed assignment for a neurosurgery patient. a few hours later, the neurosurgeon called asking where his patient was. i forgot i had a bed assignment and hadn't coordinated transportation. he was pissed rightfully so. i was superhard on myself. my manager pointed out the bed assignment came in during high ambulance radio traffic, for which i was responsible. she asked what i would do to prevent this in the future. i said i'd always, immediately, put the bed assignment in the patient record it changed a status timer on the main screen. she said okay, sounds good. that was it. i still kicked myself and called myself an idiot. i did a lot correctly, yet i kept kicking myself for this mistake. i learned about selfbullying in may this year. i found a book called don't be your own bully. it's ostensibly a book for kids i'm a middleaged adult, but don't let that fool you. it has great information in it. what we did is called filtering we filtered our experience, dismissed everything that went right, and focused on what went wrong. we both had so much go right, even when busier than normal. but we made mistakes. it happens. in my favorite show, the owl house, the main character, a teen named luz, tells her mom she messed up again. her mom has a very pointed conversation with her you keep messing up? messing up is a part of living! and gives several examples where she messed up scheduling wisdom teeth surgery the day before her wedding, road raging against luz' school principal, selling energy drinks for a pyramid scheme for three years. it happens. we easily forgive and reassure others, but not ourselves. if a friend described that day to you, wouldn't you say hey, you were busier than normal, and yet you kicked butt! one mistake in an 8 6, 10, 12, whateverhour shift? you did great! you'd say that to your friend, right? can you be your own friend and tell yourself that? don't expect this to change overnight. it takes practice. but you can do this. and, slowly, you'll find yourself being more positive in the face of mistakes. learn from the mistakes. just recognize they are mistakes, and you're allowed to make them without beating yourself up.</data>

  <data key="d1">im a 45 year old man. im definitely not new to anxiety it has really put me through the wringer over the years. i dont have panic attacks, but i have the episodes of tremendous, unprovoked fear that can go on for hours. i say i dont have panic attacks, since panic attacks are of briefer duration, in my understanding. last spring, anxiety was the worst its ever been or me. in addition to the usual episodes of terror, most of the time when i would try to fall asleep, i would jolt awake in terror. this would happen to me even if i took 1 mg of klonopin and i think most people would agree that is an effective dose of a potent benzodiazepine. additionally, im not a frequent user of benzodiazepines, and cant see tolerance being an issue there. if i did fall asleep without incident, chances are i would wake up terrified. during the day, i would wring my hands, fidget, squirm, and beg my with to tell me that at some point this would go away. after a long day fighting anxiety, i would sometimes hid in my closet and sob. its exhausting on all levels to have anxiety. but that period last spring just described was the worst its ever been for me. ive had several other periods where anxiety consumed just about every aspect of the day. it may have been fixated worrying about something, or persistent feelings of terror, or just the fear that it will never get better. most of the books i have are selfhelp books about anxiety and depression. ive seen lots of doctors, and ive taken lots of medications. ive found some things that work for me at least. and ive found some things that definitely make things worse.</data>

  <data key="d1">with this what helps is to accept how the worst outcome might indeed happen. because this is coming from being too uncomfortable with uncertainty. and if you accept the very worst, the fear loses power, making the thinking stop. at the same time you must avoid reassurance seeking.</data>

  <data key="d1">this may be a comfort of sorts there is radiation in the earth. it's everywhere. we're exposed to it constantly and our ancestors were, too. when you get an xray or ct scan or what have you you're basically just getting three day's normal doses in one day. it's such a negligible amount at the end of the day. the reason the doctors step out of the room to do the scan is because if they didn't they'd be receiving those doses non stop throughout their work day and they'd get really sick from it quickly. but a few tests here and there is absolutely nothing and the radiation is dispelled from the body very quickly. at least that's what the dentist told me when he did like 5 xrays in one visit after i got a root canal and expressed the same worry to him.</data>

  <data key="d1">anxiety is all in the mind, but it can manifest itself with physical symptoms. its kinda like a loop your brain has anxiety, which leads to physical symptoms, which reinforces to your brain that you are experiencing anxiety. the beta blockers calm your body, which signals to the brain that youre not anxious. now your brain feels calm and thinks rationally because it isnt being triggered by physical symptoms. anxiety is still a mental health issue.</data>

  <data key="d1">hit the gym if you can! i am so lazy when it comes to physical stuff so i get how hard it is to muster up the motivation. plus it can also be anxiety inducing. but youll feel better about yourself and your body, and the chemical stuff going on inside you during a workout is often cited by therapist folks as beneficial to mental health try if you can! start easy, then build up. also, working out doesnt have to mean cardio. lifting is a great and comparatively easier way to get exercise in!</data>

  <data key="d1">can you afford to go to therapy or to consult a doctor? if you can, i would recommend to start looking at those options first. if you can't, i will leave you some tips try meditation. i personally find the noting technique from headspace meditation really useful. it is mostly about accepting and acknowledging what you are feeling at the moment. there is even research behind it. drink enough water reduce your caffeine consumption try to do some physical activity. even a walk can be helpful. try some healthy foods that can help you lessen anxiety it would best to speak to a doctor, but for me magnesium supplements really helped me to reduce my anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel pressure from everywhere to adapt and behave like everyone else , but i never was like anyone else. i feel ostracized and i fear what the future holds for me. to the extent you can, don't give in to the pressure. allow yourself to be yourself. nobody should be punished for who they are! luz noceda,the owl house ultimately, you're going to be more comfortable being you than being a facade. you have to live with yourself everyday. no one else does. this has been a hard lesson coming for me. i'm a middleaged father with a collegeager and a high schooler. in the last couple of years, i've finally let myself relax and be me. also, in general, as you get older, the people you're around tend to be better. i'm a network engineer on a team with great people. as you get older, more people realize that the quirky stuff just doesn't matter. i'm not saying it's fast i wish it was. but it typically happens. what you study in university is not a lifetime sentence. what you choose for a career is not a lifetime sentence. out of high school, i was a secretary, then an emt both field and dispatch, then a paramedic student didn't finish my cert, then communications in an er answering phones, paging doctors, taking ambulance reports, coordinating inbound transfers, etc., then the er computer geek, and now a network engineer. it took me about 15 years for that progression. network engineers, as we know them, didn't even exist when i was a kid. i couldn't have said i wanna be a network engineer when i grow up! it's possible you'll land somewhere in a position that doesn't even exist yet, and you'll love it. i really don't know what to say about relationships. i'm a big believer in close relationships developing from friendships. this doesn't work with everyone, but you've got a lot of time. neither my college ager nor my high schooler are in close relationships right now. as a parent, i'm not concerned, not by a long shot. i understand the concern, though. if you can allow yourself to be yourself, then you'll get involved in things you really enjoy, and you'll meet people, develop friendships, through those activities. i'm a big believer in counseling. a counselor can give you more personal perspective of what goes on in the real world. it might ease your fears and anxiety. talk to your school about counseling.</data>

  <data key="d1">the owl house toh is such a fantastic show. it's also the show that forced me into counseling and to look at myself in several areas, including my mental health. i see so many things in luz that i see in myself. it's not an exaggeration that at least a year of the last two years of counseling have been sessions directly stemming from toh typically luz thinks or feels some way, or does something, and i can directly relate to her thought or action. and it takes a few sessions to get a handle on. it's this counseling that diagnosed my anxiety, among other things. it's pretty cute for the first 1.5 seasons, then it gets much more serious. but if you have d, you can binge it, which is fortunate. i strongly encourage watching it.</data>

  <data key="d1">speaking as someone who has been in your exact shoes right now, and chose to go down the alcohol and other substances route? please dont do it. it may work great for a while, in my case 3 years i felt like it was working and i had everything under control. looking back? i fell off that slippery slope very early on and didnt even realize it and here we are current day and i struggle to stay sober for more than 7 days at a time without going on a 2 or 3 day bender. there are so many other better options, and ill even help you find them, if itll stop you from trying what youre thinking. alcohol withdrawals are the closest thing to hell you can find on earth, and even if you dont get withdrawals, alcohol makes your day to day anxiety worse and you will spiral even more from it. worse anxiety from alcohol, more drinking to mask it, rinse and repeat.</data>

  <data key="d1">please do. it is a very slippery slope when you try to manage recreational substance use, and i promise by the time you get to that point where youre at your limit you set, its too late. youll tell yourself that one extra shot wont hurt. that one shot in the morning to help the hangover or anxiety wont hurt. instead of waiting til the weekend its okay to drink during the week. it happens way too fast. i dont want to sound like one of those people, because i know how much it frustrated me when i was looking for answers. but have you tried breathing exercises? therapy? ice baths? any other alternatives to substances? when i was looking i tried breathing and thought it was bullshit until i found a couple specific breathing methods that work great at actually calming you down. ice baths have also been life changing for me. im only on appointment 3 for therapy so i wont say its working yet. even the meds doctors can give, whether it be benzos or anti depressants, you have side effects and often have rough withdrawals that make it borderline impossible to come off of. ask me how i know that. sometimes meds are 100 necessary and ill never judge anyone who takes them, but before you go down that road unprepared, please try everything you can first!</data>

  <data key="d1">no, those would be benzos and you cant take those longterm for anxiety. theyre meant to be emergency panic attack aids and sedate you theyre also incredibly addictive. if you have chronic daily anxiety you take something longterm. meds like those can take 46 weeks to take affect, which is why people tend to get impatient when one does work.</data>

  <data key="d1">sounds like pristiq might not be the drug for you. visit your doctor about trying a new one, but be carefulyou're going to have to wean yourself off the pristiq gradually, because otherwise you might go through pretty unpleasant withdrawals. i use pristiq and have missed a dose a few times, and the results are wretched. that said, i've personally only used pristiq for depression, not anxiety. i've used a few medications for anxiety specifically, so i'm not sure if the pristiq was ever going to help your anxiety even if does ease any depression you might have.</data>

  <data key="d1">curing your psych issues with alcohol and ketamine is absolutely unacceptable and it will put you in icu with complications like breath depression, coma, seizures, and even clinical death and vegetable state for the rest of your life. there are suicidal tendencies, im pretty sure that some kind of unpleasant depression is what happens to you. if you are kind of seeking for help this way find yourself a good therapist. unfortunately even our parents may be completely indifferent about our problems because they dont want to admit their mistakes or simply dont care tired of life.</data>

  <data key="d1">if this isn't my life summed up. it started as anxiety with panic attacks. then came the social anxiety when i never had that at any point in my life i did find that i felt a lot better finally getting it off my chest and telling my family and friends about how bad my anxiety is, and they were all incredibly supportive. thankfully there still is a side of me that does occasionally shame myself for getting incredible anxiety when i go out somewhere. the only thing that kinda helps is mentally preparing myself to leave my house</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah emotional build up and hormones clogging your system can do that to you if you don't address them or find ways to expel it in a positive way and depending on how you try to handle it it can grow and become so much worse for years i suppressed myself and held back this has led to a gradual increase in my anxiety over the years that i myself couldn't perceive until a few months a go it had all swelled up to such a degree that i had a breakdown and was in such a heightened state of anxiety i could barley function days at a time. i am better now but i am nowhere close to the way i was before i still need to work on expressing all of this out of my system. exercise and talking to people has helped and so has trying to pick up a few hobbies to keep me busy</data>

  <data key="d1">your feelings, my friend, are valid. and the best thing you can do it what youve already done see your doctor, order some labs, and do a general workup. in the absence of anything physically showing up, anxiety can have some seriously physical manifestations. the worst case scenario if nothing is wrong is that you saw your doctor which is a healthy thing to do and verified your health status. if there is something, youll be catching it and taking care of it right away. let me leave you with something, though. i also had a time where i thought something more than anxiety was going on with me. i was right. and im getting treated now. listen to your gut, even though i know like me your anxiety messes heavily with it.</data>

  <data key="d1">sorry for checking your other posts, trying to pass time in an unpleasant situation. this sounds like the hppd i experienced after dmt. it got better over a few months. i can still get visuals even using low doses of cannabis years later, if i'm very anxious to start. they become less distressing over time. you can try learning grounding techniques if they're bothering you. but yeah, anxiety can make it flare, just remember that there's nothing actually wrong with you in the sense that your brain is broken or you're gonna go crazy or something. it's just annoying symptoms, that's all.</data>

  <data key="d1">no prob. anxiety is still more or less my baseline, but my functioning within it has improved a lot. you really have to learn how to talk to yourself as well. even if you're just mentally repeating this is hppd, this won't be forever in your head over and over, sometimes that kind of thing can help. i also brute force reset by counting to 5 in my head for each inhaleexhale cycle, but any time my mind drifts, i go back to 1. if i'm not getting anywhere, i just repeat 1 1 1 1 1 1 1, 2 2 2 2 2 2 2, etc so no other thoughts can get it. that's all moreso for panic attacks or trying to rest at night. i also take meds, that's obviously a personal choice but if qol is really suffering then the choice can be a bit easier. and i've done iop and php and lots of other shit. idk if you have the resources to get actually evaluated, or if this is even relevant to you, but i found out when i was like 30 when i was participating in a psychological study for something else that i met the criteria for pure o ocd. i was pretty exhausted with treatment at that point, but reframing things i had been viewing as anxiety bordering on psychosis as per previous diagnoses for years really helped me feel more capable of managing of them. so maybe you have something underlying, especially if you are panicking this much. it seems painful and unpleasant. i hope it gets better for you and there are at least some ideas to toss around in here.</data>

  <data key="d1">it may be helpful to tell you my story. some of my earliest memories are of me telling my mom, im worried. i was probably 5 years old at that time, and i just didnt have a was to express that an unsettled, apprehensive feeling would overcome me. my anxiety was never addressed as a child, and as i grew older i refused to admit it was a problem. but it definitely kept me from living a full life. if i had treated it successfully in my 20s, i may have earned a phd too. as it was, earning a masters degree completely burned me out. eventually in my late 30s, as stress and life accumulated, i couldnt ignore that anxiety was a problem for me. what started as stress and worry became episodes of overwhelming fear. i was given an ssri by a doctor. not only did it not work it made things much worse. at that point, i had to find a solution to stay employed and keep supporting my family. luckily i found a doctor that really understood me, and trusted me. the treatment regimen i got onto was that i would take klonopin 3 4 days per week on work days, mainly, at about 0.5 to 1 mg per day. i believe this was a successful treatment for me because 1 klonopin works, while other medicines dont for me, anyway. 2 it allowed me to stay employed, which lifted a huge burden. bonus i started to enjoy my job again, not being terribly anxious anymore. 3 for me, just having 3 4 days off from anxiety made the rest of the week okay. those days with the help of klonopin, and without the burden of undue stress, tension, fear, worry allowed some real healing to take place. i didnt believe that klonopin would solve any problems on its own i only saw it as an ally. it gave me a break from anxiety, and allowed me to get my bearings in order to do the things i needed to do to continue to heal being all the other nonmedication things people do. i was always conscientious about taking klonopin too often. so, like i said, i only took it 34 days per week. there were some days when i didnt take it that were difficult and when i really wanted to take one. but it just seemed really clear to me that having a few bad days like that was far better than taking klonopin every day or not at all. i was so conscientious about benzodiazepine dependence that i kept a notebook of my daily moodfeelings and ifhow much klonopin i took. my dr and i would review this it every appointment. i continued taking klonopin in this way for about 1.5 years. on days i took it, i started at 0.5 1 mg per day, but over time that became 0.25 0.5 mg per day. and then one day i didnt need it anymore. when that day came i just quit taking it. i never had any physical or emotional dependence set in, nor any withdrawals when i quit. right as i started taking klonopin, i felt so bad that i really didnt see that i would survive anxiety. for me, there is something about the experience of being anxious that leaves me convinced that it will never end. so, to me i have some amazement at my own story, given how bad i was when i started and how well i had become later on. but, i emphasize, i just used klonopin as an ally and i worked really hard to get better as it held my hand. that was about 4 years ago. ive recently had a resurgence in my anxiety, but its purely the result of having made some really stupid decisions.</data>

  <data key="d1">anxiety often manifests in chest pain because the blood pools to your heart when your body thinks youre in danger as part of the fight or flight response. stress toys can be helpful when you feel it coming, on partly just because of the distraction, but also because it encourages the blood to go back to your extremities hands rather than all pooling to your heart. similarly, its worthwhile to pay attention to your body position because people often curl up or tense their shoulders inward to the chest without realizing when dealing with an anxiety episode which can somewhat exacerbate it. there can also be pretty mundane and harmless reasons for chest pains like heartburn, a sore back sometimes i confuse upper back ache for chest pain or a precordial catch random sharp chest pains for a few minutes that happen because of a pinched nerve and are totally harmless. one piece of advice thats helped me is remembering that if you were having a medical emergency you probably wouldnt be in doubtquestioning it, your body would be screaming at you, not whispering doubtfully.</data>

  <data key="d1">this is from reassurance seeking. by frequently visiting doctors and constantly checking the symptoms and i'm guessing googling, you are feeding this anxiety. the way it works is, this is coming from low tolerance of uncertainty. by reassurance seeking you are further lowering this tolerance, resulting in more frequent and stronger anxiety. the solution is to stop with all the reassurance, stay in uncertainty and that way slowly become fine with uncertainty, making the anxiety stop. though when it's that bad then you probably need anxiety medication too.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes my anxiety is especially bad when shes a really attractive hairdresser, my anxiety gets worse hahaha i'm generally confident around women but when it comes to something as intimate as a haircut i prefer less tension. they always want to talk too, and then when i dont talk it feels like a long awkward silence, and start ovetthinking everything. its the worst. because you can't just get up and leave with half a haircut, you are stuck there! i miss my old hair dresser, she was an old chinese lady. she knew how to cut my hair, because i have really thick hair, she told me i have asian hair lol. she wouldn't talk, or mess around, she would just get the job done nice and quick and then she would say 12 dolla! simple to the point. zero anxiety. best hairdresser i've ever had. plus 12 dollars was a really good price i always tipped her.</data>

  <data key="d1">xanax. i would say thats the ultimate immediate stoppage to a panic attack. my anxiety stems from cardiophobia so im always on edge thinking im having a heart attack. my panic attacks are basically me thinking im having a heart attack and maybe 30 mins after taking a xanax, almost all my symptoms are gone and im pretty much sedated.</data>

  <data key="d1">i understand that may have been your personal experience i dont think thats correct at all, for vast majority of people. in fact they have found exercise consistent, for 12 weeks to be about as effective as meds on average or for example even journaling was found to be almost as effective as therapy. i think the key is to combine as many good habits as possible, and clearly for each individual one thing helps more or less than it would for others. but on average, majority of people will see a huge benefit from good sleep, regular exercise, mindfulness practice, positive social interactions, good nutrition, stress reduction, journaling and worksheets, medication, therapy, reading self help books or podcasts, adaptogenic supplements etc. yea trauma is awful and of course therapy should be at the center of that recovery, but the more of the above that someone can implement the better, i feel like my disorder is completely under control now and it took years to get there but i can vouch for those habits having a huge huge impact</data>

  <data key="d1">it absolutely does alter the chemistry of your brain when a human encounters trauma, the brain releases cortisol and norepinephrine as a stress response. too much of these chemicals being released can permanently alter your brain by changing the way certain neurotransmitters function. thats literally why cptsd and ptsd exist. google it</data>

  <data key="d1">i hear you and i promise im empathetic and respectful. just hear me out. the meds help to shut up your mind, but without the meds the volume is still loud. a good therapist can help you get to the root on your struggles and deal with each individual reason for your anxiety. once you deal with the fundamental issues, you struggle less. your mind is quieter without the meds. its like youre bleeding and wont clot, and you just keep changing the bandages to manage the blood but youre not managing the clotting.</data>

  <data key="d1">this is just straight up fear mongering. ive had benzo prescriptions in the past. if youre actually an anxious person, the relief you get from therapeutic doses alone is enough to prevent you from abusing it. at least for me. my anxiety is the root cause of addiction so when its gone i have no addictive urges. and thats how it is for most people that actually have anxiety. the issue is people who dont actually have anxiety go to their doctors when theyre stressed and get benzos and abuse them. this is what happened for the past few decades so their solution was just a blanket ban on prescribing benzos for like 99 of clinics. they made it impossible to get for people with actual anxiety. such bullshit.</data>

  <data key="d1">sounds like severe anxietypanic. im going through the same too. if your scans xrays are coming back normal, then everything should be good. first step to feeling peace is reminding yourself that these are just emotions and they will pass. distracting yourself will help a lot, pick up new hobbies or soothing ones you enjoy. drink plenty of water, get some walks in, yoga, and breathing exercises. take some vitamin b9 and b12, as these are crucial to reducing anxiety. crying and feeling your emotions can bring ease too, let yourself express your emotions. try journaling down your feelings. if you havent started yet, therapy andor medication can be a solution too. surround yourself with positive thoughts, words and maybe healing crystals if youre into that sort of thing. heres a video on yoga poses to relax your chest and stress. theyve been helping me a bit and hopefully they help you too. take care be easy with yourself.</data>

  <data key="d1">as far as i can say anxiety comes from anger. depression comes from not getting love, problems with parents etc. anxiety develops when you are angry, when you want to slam on the table but you cant, for whatever reason. anger and anxiety is linked. anxiety is, you want to attack, you want to fight the thing which is creating you problems, you want to kill it, you want to destroy it, but you cant and therefore it internalizes as anxiety</data>

  <data key="d1">so very similar to myself ive struggled hugely over this last year not sure as to why but its here and not going away very fast, im on meds for anxiety and panic attacks but since april ive lived with constant chest pain which spreads to my neck, arms, shoulders, back and so on, ive been terrified for months and had xray, ecg and blood tests and all clear, ive been where you are and i have a cardiology test this friday which im hoping is clear but also would be good to have an answer other than anxiety, pretty silly to say but then saying its just anxiety makes me feel stupid anyway, chest pain is my main concern always left sided heart side and always sharp fleeting pains followed by palpitations and rapid heart rate then panic follows, ears ringing pins and needles in hands the lot, anyway what ive learned over the last few months is to embrace it, its there, it can be disguised as stress throughout your normal everyday life, i always thought i was pretty chill but now realise i carry so much stress and shit all day. lack of sleep doesnt help, good foods help, exercise is great but scares me that my heart rate will go to high and something will happen.. things ive taken though is just listen to yourself, youve made it past all your bad spells and you know the symptoms although they can change they are all familiar, check your family history of heart attacks or heart disease and heart problems, your age, your weight and take into account all the things you know that are good about your health and just u sweat and its anxiety playing tricks on you, trust me i do it everyday but i just roll with it now and my symptoms are still there but i chose to let them be what they are harmless, heart attacks slow your heart rate, so when it races or feels like its pulsating its probably panic or anxiety not an attack</data>

  <data key="d1">been dealing with the same for about 9 months but it was building maybe 2 months prior to that. i initiated when i noticed a weird heart beat rhythm when exercising like a skipped beat. then i noticed on a few occasions my heart wouldn't slow after exercise and would transition to panic feeling. then i had a few occasions of initially feeling faint and then suddenly like someone shot me with adrenaline. all this built to months of constant symptoms as both of you described. as well as ekg, blood work, cat scan, echo, doppler, stress test, halter monitor. all clear. i do all of the things that normally help me manage stress but no such luck anymore. exercise is rough because about half the time i feel and then convince myself i'm having a heart attack. i had one good week a few weeks ago when i first started using affirmations and framing techniques but unfortunately the struggle started back up. over all this time there were only two occasions of classical panic attacks. it's a puzzle we will have to solve.</data>

  <data key="d1">the simple answer is that it is not known. the modern process of drug discovery is akin to throwing shit at the wall and checking what sticks. there ability to predict and explain biological activity of drugs is rather limited. serotonin regulates a wide range of processes both in the brain and other areas in the body, many of which are not well understood, and an intervention into the serotonin system can affect each and any of those.</data>

  <data key="d1">addiction and physical dependency are 2 different things. a lot of people experience side effects of withdrawing from ssri, while not craving them and looking for a way to pop another pill. you can safely taper off them, either by simply reducing the dose or cross tapering to a less potent ssri and then tapering down from there.</data>

  <data key="d1">it sucks that theyre so unpredictable. for me, a big cause of my anxiety is health concerns and being hyperaware of my body and any symptoms that i feel. so a medication giving me bad side effects would just make my anxiety worse. i told my new psychiatrist that and he recommended i take a genesight test, its supposed to help tell them what medication is most and least likely to work for me. sounds kinda wild, but im trying it and hoping it actually helps me avoid some of the big scary side effects.</data>

  <data key="d1">seritonin, dopamine and norepinephrine are tied together in your brain. the same mechanism is responsible for regulation of all three so when one changes it has downstream effects on the others. the ri part of ssri means that the amount of seritonin in your cleft increases but global seritonin synthesis is actually reduced synthesis is tied to the amount in your cleft. this can result in dopamine and norepinephrine synthesis also being reduced. sexual side effects come from dopamine, motivation side effects come from both. gi symptoms occur because you have more neurons in your gut than some animals have in their brains. seritonin is used more in your gut then your brain so anything that changes either the neurotransmitter or it's receptors can cause gi issues. this is also why diet plays such a huge role in mental health, if your gut is happy then it helps to keep your brain happy. another effect of ssri's and the most meaningful for those not treating mdd, the ri is not thought to be meaningful in anxiety disorders is that they either block or activate 5ht seritonin receptors. this causes even more second and third order changes in other neurotransmitter systems gaba and glutamate being the most important which may treat symptoms but can themselves create side effects. it is possible to find drugs without side effects, i'm on trintellix right now which is perfectly effective for my gad without any side effects, but generally the older the drug the more side effects it will have as it will be developed based on outdated understanding of the brain. snri's have fewer side effects then ssri's and sndri's have even fewer side effects. ssri's are lifesaving but they are 45 year old technology based on antihistamines rather than molecules designed from scratch. it's entirely understandable why they are less targeted.</data>

  <data key="d1">nah, the point is basically we have different receptors all over our body as receptors where hormonestiny molecules in general dock is how our body transmits signals the ssri blocks the serotonin from being reabsorbed by the nerve cell that gave the signal to the next one more serotonin will float around between the 2 cells and be able to dock to a receptor from the nextthe receiving cell. thus, more signal will be sent. if we would take pure serotonin we would have to worry about rhe pure serotonin being absorbedyeeted out of our body again during the digestion it might just be reuptaken again like the serotonin our body made, so the signal time wont change. you can kinda visualise the signal stuff by envisioning that the serotonin docks to rhe receptor a little light goes on. disclaimer just a chemistry student in their master's program who took some biochemistry and medicinal chemistry. re your question we have serotonin receptors for a ton of shit, even stuff related to bleeding, so it's not easy to just target a few specific receptors in your brain.</data>

  <data key="d1">ssris do not increase serotonin levels, this is a gross oversimplification. ssris prevent setotonin from being recycled when it stimulates neurons, however they also prevent serotonin from being recycled at autoreceptors which has the immediate result of neurons releasing less serotonin, which may have little to no net immediate effect on serotonergic transmission or even a negative effect. there are also perhaps a dozen subtypes of serotonin receptor, some beneficial some may actually exasperate the issue. it is currently largely believed that ssris work because over a period of weeks the autoreceptors that self regulate serotonin desensitize. this remains a theory, the whole thing in terms of how clinically benefit is archieved is poorly understood. as for side effects, it is entirely possible that ssris may do other things in the body possibly completely unrelated to serotonin that are poorly understood.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's because the processes of chemicals in the brain and how different things affect them is much more complex than you're making it out to be. it's not as simple as exercise serotonin in brain good having an excessive amount of serotonin freefloating in the brain is actually associated with schizophrenia....but there are also a bunch of other wacky chemical processes going on at the same time that produce the symptoms of schizophrenia. however if i present that oversimplification in a vacuum, you would think wow, serotonin bad!! there are a variety of chemicals that are released during exercise that contribute to feeling good. serotonin is active in many more processes in the body besides just mood. in addition the effects of pharmaceuticals are going to be much more dramatic than any of the things you listed. you can't radically alter a part of the endocrine system as complicated as neurotransmitters and expect there to be no changes to any of the many things they affect. there's nothing in the pills that cause the side effects, it's a direct result of fucking with something very complicated i'm all for people deciding meds aren't for them i've tried several and ultimately decided it wasn't worth it but representing psychotropics as if they have some sort of poison put in them that causes side effects on purpose is disingenuous and oversimplifying things</data>

  <data key="d1">there is a lot of really great information here. however i also wanted to just put my experience with side effects and what my doctor explained to me. i tried an ssri for a year and felt flat for that year so i stopped, then my new doctor put me on an snri for a couple weeks and i stopped because the side effects were bad and not going away i had become apathetic to basically everything, then i tried an axiolytic for a week and the side effects were even more severe. none of these three worked for me so i went in and actually spoke with my doctor. out of curiosity he gave me the addadhd questionnaire and i scored much higher on that than my anxietydepression questionnaire. he suggested that the depression and anxiety could actually be a symptom of untreated adhdadd. going on to say that if that were the case, taking these anti anxiety medication was actually throwing my serotonin levels out of balance rather than in balance, as someone with more clinical anxietydepression would have lower than adequate levels. i am now on a stimulant and am doing much better, not really any severe side effects and am really feeling the benefits of it. my anxiety and depression are at about 20 of what they once were. not saying that this is for sure the case for you, but might be something to think about.</data>

  <data key="d1">there is a lot of really great information here. however i also wanted to just put my experience with side effects and what my doctor explained to me. i tried an ssri for a year and felt flat for that year so i stopped, then my new doctor put me on an snri for a couple weeks and i stopped because the side effects were bad and not going away i had become apathetic to basically everything, then i tried an axiolytic for a week and the side effects were even more severe. none of these three worked for me so i went in and actually spoke with my doctor. out of curiosity he gave me the addadhd questionnaire and i scored much higher on that than my anxietydepression questionnaire. he suggested that the depression and anxiety could actually be a symptom of untreated adhdadd. going on to say that if that were the case, taking these anti anxiety medication was actually throwing my serotonin levels out of balance rather than in balance, as someone with more clinical anxietydepression would have lower than adequate levels. i am now on a stimulant and am doing much better, not really any severe side effects and am really feeling the benefits of it. my anxiety and depression are at about 20 of what they once were. not saying that this is for sure the case for you, but might be something to think about.</data>

  <data key="d1">there's a limited number of monoamines in the brain so preventing reuptake to increase availability on some neurons means that other processes will also be affected. this is also why there are so many different types of snris and sris so that one with minimal side effects can be found.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think you have the wrong frame of reference here. ssris actually have fewer side effects than almost any other psychiatric med. let's explore why. first, neither yoga nor foods 'increase seratonin in the brain' in a meaningful way, and anyone who tells you they do doesn't really understand neuroscience and is probably using 'increase seratonin' as some sort of stand in for 'does something to make you feel better.' this is not to knock yoga, it has tons of proven effects on mood. but whatever its mechanism of action, it isn't a broad based increase in seratonin levels. almost every neurotransmitter is highly multifunctional. pop neuroscience treats seratonin and dopamine as 'happy chemicals', but that's not what they are at all. seratonin regulates mood, but also gut movement, memory, vomiting, vasoconstriction, appetite, sexual arousal and sleep. so a drug that affects seratonin could affect any of those functions. ssris have lower side effect rates than alternatives for a bunch of reasons. one is they are selective earlier antidepressants, and modern antipsycotics, act on a range of neurotransmitters, meaning they have even more of a chance of messing with other functions in the body. they also tend to have a less 'spiky' effect on seratonin levels.</data>

  <data key="d1">that explanation is kind of an overgeneralization. some meds are because people noticed certain substances have a certain effect and the active chemical is isolated and converted to a drug. discovery of how that works may work in retrospect. a lot of drugs are actually based on understandings of how things work mechanistically. sometimes however, the drug has an unintended effect or has a different mechanism than what was originally proposed. gabapentin works for painanxiety. from the name, it was thought to target gaba like benzosalcoholbarbituates but it actually works differently. ssris are also thought to work in ways outside the original monoamine hypotheses.</data>

  <data key="d1">so we dont have a totally air tight understanding of all the effects ssris and snris have on the body. raising serotonin and dopamine through something like exercise will never reach the same sustained circulating levels that you see in someone on medication. your body adjusts to the medication and starts to regulate receptor number differently. serotonin and related neurotransmitters regulate a lot in your body, not just related to neurology. side effects usually diminish some as youre on medication longer because your body is able to adjust, but that often also means that meds stop being as effective for what they are treating. people also metabolize and react to medications, even in the same class, very differently and we dont totally understand why that is. all psych med prescribing is a balancing act of getting the persons psychiatric condition stable without too many side effects. ill also add in to anyone worried about starting ssris or snris. yes there can be side effects, no it is not guaranteed you will experience all or even any of the side effects. ive been on multiple medications and there have been many that i had no side effects on. i never experienced sexual dysfunction from any. if you are struggling with anxiety i can tell you that finding the medication that works with your body is worth it. the process can be frustrating because unfortunately it is still a lot of guess work, but you do not realize how miserable you are until the day you find a medication that makes you feel normal.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have taken a high dosage of ssri in one form or another since i was 12. i stopped taking it after 10 years of continuous use, but not by choice. i couldnt get a refill because of a wildfire the hospital was partially burned . i went through withdrawals, it was uncomfortable but not soso terrible. later, i found videos of ssri withdrawals on youtube, they were disturbing. i got so lucky with my withdrawal. although, i could have reschedule my appointment after a couple of weeks, i was so anxious without them that it took me 3 months to call them to reschedule. bro, i am my worst enemy. ssri work okay for me, and no major side effects.although i wish i didnt take any them,no, i wish i wasnt so anxious</data>

  <data key="d1">there is no reason why an ssri can't start working right when you take it. serum stable peak effect is reached in about a week depending on drug. what the drug does to your brain on day 1 is the same as it is on day 100. many people respond quickly and many people take a long time to respond. this is largely dependent on the specific dysfunction that causes their disorder. those with a true sert issue or a 5ht issue will see an improvement right away with the right drug. those with dysfunction where the drug is treating as a second or third order effect it can take longer. its highly likely that the reason they work is how the brain reacts to the changes. this is only sort of the case with mdd and a few other depression disorders because of how they are thought to function. anxiety disorders are mostly directly neurotransmitter issues rather than the more systemic issue depression disorders tend to be. would it work just by increasing the serotonin levels if they actually did this discontinuation wouldn't be a problem. almost all of the annoying symptoms are caused by the delay between sert inhibition being turned off and seritonin synthesis adjusting up.</data>

  <data key="d1">ive been on meds since i was 8. weve been using ssris in children for long enough to have data that they are safe. there is an increased risk of suicidal ideation with some meds and high doses usually arent recommended because of the still developing neural networks. but brains are so plastic the odds of there being long term negative effects are slim. its actually more likely that being on medication helps to reinforce those healthy neural pathways in the developing brain rather than the pathological ones you would see in unmedicated anxiety. thats not to say i want to throw meds at every anxious kid. there are risks to any medication and the side effects can be shitty. but for a kid like me who would have been fully non functional otherwise, you have to do what you can.</data>

  <data key="d1">many medications cause physical dependence. not just psych meds. that is not the same as addiction. the odds of your cousins emotional issues being from antidepressants are incredibly low. pssd can happen but its incredibly rare. something people should be made aware of, but not a reason to not take a needed medication. thyroid medication absolutely messes with your emotions. thyroid hormones regulate a ton in your body including, you guessed it, serotonin. does that mean you shouldnt take it? absolutely not, im sure you need it if your thyroid isnt functioning correctly. just like people whose brains arent functioning correctly sometimes need medication. fear mongering to people who already have anxiety disorders based on a single anecdote a family member experienced is irresponsible.</data>

  <data key="d1">i mean even my therapist said ssri is merely a walking cane and it won't fix anything. it just helps you function. it won't cure your anxiety or depression, it just numbs you so you won't care if you're anxiousdepressed or not. i think even as a concept that's pretty awful. thyroid medication however gives you the hormone in tablet form because your body doesn't produce it. and you don't know my family member, i do and he has said the problem began when started taking the pills and persisted after he quit them. pretty clear case of pssd even if it is incredibly rare. people should know the risks before taking any meds, i think it applies to ssri too. telling the risks of them is not fear mongering. especially since side effects seem to be much more common than not having any. but you're clearly on the big pharma boat here so i guess everything i say is in vain</data>

  <data key="d1">lol im not in the big pharma boat. i have no financial stake in this. i agree people should be fully informed of all possibilities before consenting to any medical treatment. but you are spreading false information. ssris do not numb you if you are on the proper med at the proper dose. yes they are not a cure all for a severe disorder, but they can help people enough that they are able to actually learn and utilize other tools for coping. they can keep people from killing themselves. they can allow people to leave the house again. for some people, myself included, they are absolutely necessary for being functional. i dont know your family member. i dont have to. i believe they experienced these things and i also believe a single case study should not have an impact on research based prescribing decisions. your thyroid medication is raising hormone levels. ssris are raising a neurotransmitter level. both treat disorders where something is low or nonexistent in someone. and then there are a bunch of secondary effects after that. in both cases. you could make an argument that all cases of anxiety and depression are not as serotonin related as we once thought, but thats a different topic entirely. making it sound like ssris will turn you into a zombie and permanently ruin your life is fear mongering. its not neutrally presenting risk and benefit so people can make an informed decision. essentially calling me a big pharma shill because i have points of contention with your argument is enough evidence that what you are here doing is fear mongering. i want people to make informed decisions to do what is best for them, i dont want them refusing potentially necessary care out of excessive fear.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have a full arsenal. lol. i definitely take magnesium and make sure all of my other vitamins are balanced. i also use a combination of low dose melatonin and cbd strains for sleep and relaxation. for me at least, this only works in combination with a regular as in every day fitness routine. a doctor said something very profound to me a while ago anxiety is in your body, not your mind. what he meant by that is that anxiety is a disorder that primarily impacts the nervous system and we process the effects of it in our conscious minds. the problem for us is that our nervous system doesnt understand any of our thoughts but our brains can understand the nervous system. this where the other half of my regimen comes in. you must begin if you are not already have a good fitness and wellness plan. for that i focus on endurance training to keep my body healthy and practice yoga. yoga has a dual benefit teaching you how to understand every movement and breath in your body which results in you being more conscious about what your body is doing. whether or not you can hit a specific pose is irrelevant, its understanding how your breath and mind affect your movement. this has direct utility when it comes to anxiety. once you understand how your body operates you can in a way control what it does. i am by no means anxiety free, but when the triggers come i go back to my breath work and body scan activities and my mind begins to calm. once you are able to stop the rumination clarity comes faster.</data>

  <data key="d1">some of the information here is wrong. there is a few good answers. it all depends on the physiological effects of the medication. most ssri's are going to bind to certain neurons and receptors and stimulate them such as the ctz, which regulates nausea and vomiting causing you to feel nauseas or vomit with this medication. the ctz also, is linked to serotonin which is going to cause an increase in serotonin. distinguishing which receptors are being effected and latched onto by the medication is a good way to tell what symptoms are most likely going to be had. another good example is migraine medication. cgrp antagonists, tricyclic anti depressants , gpants, botox, etc. all work by laching onto a certain receptor in the brain preventing them from producing cgrp, substance p. etc. but with that comes side effects becasue those receptors are responsible for other things as well.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi there! congratulation on your first job! a little background about me real quick. i am 30, finished university a while ago now and ive been working in professional jobs for maybe around 9 years. i suffer from severe anxiety with panic attacks, depression and ptsd. i do take medication, see a therapist and a nurse practitioner for med management. i also use marijuana very frequently for my anxiety and help with sleeping bad sunday anxiety. what i will say is that every day is a struggle. you will have good days and bad days. i urge you to fill out any disability paperwork as long as you have a diagnosis. if you live in the us, fill out family medical leave act paperwork for your condition to protect your job if you need intermittent leave or another type of leave. speak with your human resources department for more information. what you confide in them is confidential and will remain confidential. you are not required to disclose any information that you do not want to to your direct supervisor. a first job is exciting and scary on a base level. you are currently in a transition period. college to full time work is a major life event and life events will always have some kind of impact on your anxiety. but remember that the people you work with are just people. every one of them had a first job and every one of them has their own personal struggle. some of them may also suffer from mental illness or have suffered from mental illness at some point in their life. something that has helped me in my life is trying to be open about my mental health as much as i am comfortable. while you are not required to do so by any means, sometimes opening up to a coworker or a supervisor a little bit about your mental health might give you the confidence to deal with a panic attack at work or a day where you just arent feeling it. taking walks on your break or meditating in your car can also be really helpful as well. your first priority is yourself and your overall wellbeing. i wish you the best of luck in life and all your future endeavors!</data>

  <data key="d1">this might come off as crazy, but psilocybin therapy has been approved for treatment resistant depression, you will need a therapist to guide you and it is only available in a few countries and states in the us. it is used off label by a lot of therapists now. coincidentally mdma therapy has been approved for ptsd and lsd is awaiting it's second phase 3 trial for depression and anxiety, pantogam and mebicar have a slight beneficial effect, but it beats benzo use. if you can find a provider willing to prescribe a proper benzo taper long term, that is probably the best option. but regular use will only destroy your life,</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, sorry to hear about your distress. i'm emetophobic too and i know how much that sucks. vomiting can indeed be a stress reaction and it happens to a lot of mammals. i've heard it explained that it is because the body feels that it's a good idea to get rid off stuff so that it can put all its focus on fleeing the threatening situation instead of taking care of those, but i don't know how much truth is in that. i do know that when we enter a sympathetic activation ie fightflight the body downprioritizes functions that are deemed unnecessary for immediate survival and the braingut communication is often among the first ones to go which can lead to a plethora of gutrelated symptoms like indigestion, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, pain etc. if i were you i wouldn't worry about a stomach bug. the reason you vomited yellow bile was probably because your stomach was empty. which also can lead to nausea since an empty stomach can mimic the movement and therefore the signals of a sick one. remember to drink and get some electrolytes down to compensate your body for the loss of fluids.</data>

  <data key="d1">my brain is super active with that sort of thing. i ask myself if this thought is based on facts or assumption. i weigh the facts for the thought and against the thought. then if there are no facts to support my thought i ask myself if its catastrophizing. if it is i ask myself if i am going to choose to worry about it. i think this exercise is rooted in a cbt therapy approach and its been really helpful for me to see my thoughts and not believe everything my brain pumps out. anxiety is rooted in a lot of things, but a lot of it a negative view of the future, poor compartmentalization, and the inability to argue an invalid thought.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think it's important that you rule out physical issues that could help reduce the anxiety, and then you can take it from there. have someone you trust go with you to get the blood work done, and let the nurse know about your fear so they can be gentle about it. remind yourself that you're in the safest possible setting if something bad was to happen which it won't!.</data>

  <data key="d1">there is a technique i learnt that you might try which doesn't replace therapy of course, but might help in the short term. basically, every day you set aside a certain amount of time e.g. 2030 minutes to think about what makes you anxious. you think really hard about the things that make you anxious, imagine all the worst case scenarios etc. when the time's up you can set a timer, you stop and get back to your normal day. i know it doesn't sound easy or pleasant, but it's pretty effective. the idea behind it is that if you willingly search for the anxiety and focus on it for a while, it won't come back as much to bother you.</data>

  <data key="d1">first of all you need to calm down because your panicking will only make it harder to write. im assuming its an essay or a term paper? you mention a draft. if so you need to go to a quiet area and spread everything out that youll need. turn off the tv and music. turn off your cellphone and maybe even better, out it in another room so you wont be tempted. its hard for me to really help you because i dont know what is supposed to be in your portfolio and what the assignment is. but chunk the work. do it one task at a time. if its a term paper, research quickly , then move on to mapping out on a flow map how you want to arrange the paper. add and transitions and then write. an essay? then map out what you want to write about first using a flow map. then move on to adding transitions and then write. you can manage a first draft if youre diligent.</data>

  <data key="d1">youre not going to die, but you need to get it looked at and it truly cant wait anymore, im sorry. your tooth died, and the rest of it needs to be pulled if you think you have an infection, youve officially hit the cant ignore it anymore part. im 24 and i went through the exact same things due to mental health. i lost a filling, couldnt afford to refill it, and subsequently lost the tooth. had a hole in another filling that was huge and they put a cap on it. honestly if its at the back no one will really see, and it is going to feel so much better try to think of it that way. i had to go to a dentist around 5 times in a 6 month period for fillings and a root canal. none of them were pleasant, but i can honestly say it wasnt as bad as i thought. in my experience theyve now really leaned away from the shaming, i had no one ask me how i had let it get that bad or anything else like i had feared. if they try, tell em it shouldnt matter. youve got this!!</data>

  <data key="d1">my one piece of advice is to stay off googlewebmd. it will drive you insane. it will lead you to the worst possible assumption no matter what. the best thing you can do is see your doctor. explain all of your concerns and issues you're feeling. have them addressed one by one. your doctor will be able to check or let you know why it's not a real concern.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's continuing to happen because you're likely doing something that accidentally tells it to. it's like when folks feel their heart racing, despite not even knowing what constitutes a racing heart, constantly monitoring their pulse. or someone checking their blood sugar levels or oxygen levels or blood pressure whilst continuing to have 0 medical background whatsoever. the results are absolutely worthless unless you know what you're doing. everyone with health anxiety seems to end up like this, convinced they're qualified to monitor their vitals, but very very few of them actually are. if you're doing anything, or have any kind of athome device to monitor yourself, throw it in the bin now. not tomorrow, today. its not an instant fix, you're going to have those same thoughts, but the point of doing this is to face the thoughts and have no way of checking yourself. it's a safety behaviour and is constantly extending your anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">trust me you're not the first and likely won't be the last. almost all health anxiety patients at one stage or another end up getting themselves some form of athome monitoring devices or apps. but unless someone understands the process of taking readings, the results mean nothing. example if a patient gets a blood pressure reading of 150120 health anxiety patient starts freaking out thinking this is the one and only result. death is seconds away. doctor tells you to wait 10 mins and breathe slowly and will come back to take 1 or 2 more readings and get the average. knows that the mere act of taking a reading of vitals can increase both heart rate and blood pressure, usually referred to as white coat symdrome. it's not going to be a walk in the park, i won't lie to you. its pretty tough, but absolutely necessary. you need to rid yourself of anything and everything you use to monitor yourself. it provides short term relief but it has a cost too, causing your anxiety to grow stronger. if you act like the fake threat is real, it may as well be real. so don't. next attack, sit with it and watch as it doesn't even come close to killing you.</data>

  <data key="d1">when you start anxiety meds, they can take a few weeks to do their thing. i will say that even anxiety meds aren't going to make your anxiety go away 100 but it definitely helps you learn to manage it better. meditation and yoga are amazing, fbd for sure. i like vitamin d and magnesium too. one thing you don't want to do is avoid triggers though. i know they feel awful but every time you avoid a trigger or see reassurance, you're teaching your brain something is actually dangerous or wrong. it takes practice to stop googling and i still get the urge sometimes after 8 years of recovery. it sounds like you're avoiding the reassurance which is fantastic! you're welcome to reach out if you want to connect.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi there, i'm sorry to hear about your work anxiety. i'm a life coach and i specialize in rewiring anxiety patterns. my suggestion for you is to learn how to interrupt your anxiety patterns by selfregulating. self regulation is about moving out of a stress response in your nervous system into a calm, peaceful and grounded state. what is a specific example of a moment when you're starting to feel the anxiety go up?</data>

  <data key="d1">got it. in moments like this, when you feel anxiety starting to escalate, that is exactly when you can intervene with selfregulation. the body is amazingwe have a builtin system for selfregulation. i teach people how to use breath, touch, and other somatic exercises to squash anxiety and feel better in a way that changes those nervous system pathways. i'm going to pin a video to my profile next week with 3 different ways to do this. but for now, i'll share this one with you start by focusing on a specific focal point in your environment, such as a spot on the ceiling in your case if you're lying in bed. soften your gazeit's like youre diffusing your focus. then, without moving your eyeballs, slowly begin to become more aware of your peripheral vision around the focal point, expanding your awareness outwards. keep expanding, little by little, becoming more aware of all the space around you, until its almost like you can see behind you. you will notice that inner chatter and feelings of worry dissipate. hang out here for about 1520 seconds, and then come back into focus again. repeat at least once more.</data>

  <data key="d1">one big thing is, people who go crazy psychosis etc. absolutely do not notice it, to them it's all real, they don't stop and think hell, i'm going crazy. so the fact that you're thinking you may go crazy, is a proof that you won't. your brain is operating as it should, it's just having these intrusive thoughts, that are harmless, but are caused by your anxiety. but don't worry you're safe and sound.</data>

  <data key="d1">i find having online friends helps a lot, it decreases the pressure to act a certain way in person for me. i like texting the best because i can think about what i say before i send the message too. i may a few cool friends on bumble for friends so you may have luck there! some people want to meet irl and others just want someone to chat to online. i put in my little bio thing that i have anxiety and agoraphobia and everyone was super understanding of me d i promise youre not alone in how you feel, i spent a long time feeling so lonely and isolated in my late teens and im now in my 20s a few years later and i feel like i have a lot of support and while i may not have a lot of close friends i am grateful and fulfilled with the few i do have! reminder than your age isnt a sign thats its too late or anything like that, you can be 50 and still making new friends!. the right people will find you i promise! keep being brave and keep trying your best! there are so many people out there who will embrace you, anxiety and all d</data>

  <data key="d1">one thing ill recommend is to check your university website for academic accommodations. some universities will excuse absences or give you additional test time if you disclose your mental health in advance. also keep in mind that not everyone is living with the same challenges as you, just because someone was able to get up and talk to others doesnt mean that you should be able to do so just as easily. does your university have a student counseling program you can attend? or oncampus therapy?</data>

  <data key="d1">it's a fact that you can not 'feel' your brain since your brain doesn't have the needed nerves in the brain matter. whenever we get a headache, it's the nerves and muscles around your head, between your scalp and skull. you probably got a 'nerve shot' a pulse of electricity through the nerves of your head,activating them. then, you reacted to this weird feeling, with anxiety creeping in, giving you the other symptoms.</data>

  <data key="d1">when i was 26 i got invited to the 25th birthday of a woman i'd had a crush on since high school. it was about 150km away, or 90odd miles. i went with two friends in one of their cars. this was the first time i'd seen her when she wasn't in a relationship, and as soon as i arrived she was very touchyfeely and making sure i had a full glass and a joint to smoke. it really seemed like i was going to have a great time. then i woke up at home. 90 miles away. absolutely zero recollection of anything about an hour after arriving at the party. i pieced together what happened from the two friends i was with, apparently there was some drinking competition like beer pong and i ended up drinking a lot of vodka straight. then i became a werewolf, turned into a monster i couldn't recognize. apparently i wandered around in their garden then threw a bottle through the kitchen window, then had to be restrained by 6 guys for an hour or so, struggling and fighting the whole time, until eventually my friends just threw me in the car and went home. i felt acute shame and embarassment for weeks, and it only reduced very slowly over the following months. now it's been 30 years and i still feel terrible about it. the woman actually said it was nothing, just one of those things that happens sometimes when you drink a lot, but i couldn't even bear to be around her because i was so embarassed. she tried several times to reconnect and i ghosted her, it just brought back that shame and embarassment vividly every time. i already had a long history of being a bit of a bad drunk, but not violent and agressive. i didn't really vow to never drink again, but i never did. haven't been drunk since and i only have like one beer if i'm at a wedding or something. so, yeah, i know how you feel. the good thing about not drinking is that, now, at 55 my skin and appearance is so much better than my friends who kept drinking the whole time. drinking really fucks you up over a long period.</data>

  <data key="d1">i came off escitalopram. absolutely key is a long, slow taper off. i'd half them, or take every second day, then every third. it hasn't all just come back, the anxiety. do what you can to increase that serotonin, exercise, gettung outside in natural light. you can do it. i was worried about coming off them, worried about being on them forever. but even if you were on meds long term, so what? escitalopram was literally life changing. i slept better and that was most of the battle for me, so i went to 5mg from 10 first. for months. then i thought i was in a good enough place to come off. i didn't taper properly first and i had physical effects. brain zaps especially were very uncomfortable. so i stayed on 5mg for a while more, then 2.5. even though doc said 2.5 was a non therapeutic dose. maybe it was a comfort, the idea that i had a fallback. then i tapered slowly. best of luck. on phone, sorry for formatting!</data>

  <data key="d1">okay. this is coming from uncertainty. in cases like that, trying not to care or any kind of comfort actually makes it worse. the way to stop that is to quit any checking and also when worrying, tell yourself how what you're scared of might come true and add that it's fine. even when it isn't, still tell yourself it's fine. so in your case, tell yourself maybe it won't grow back and it's fine if it doesn't. this approach slowly shuts down the worrying and it'll also become less and less scary if you keep it up.</data>

  <data key="d1">this is what helped me my main places of fear were malls, movie theaters, big stores, parking garages. the first time i got out there after my fears kind of resided was a super small movie theater that came and served you food while you watched the movie. it was a bit more expensive, but i went with my friends and had 0 anxiety. going with friends and family is the best way to help yourself begin to venture into places that scare you. once you get in there with someone to support you, you begin to realize its not as bad as you think. this is all probably stuff you have heard before but avoidance just makes it worse it will probably be pretty hard but even just a small step every day is helpful in the long run. i believe in you!</data>

  <data key="d1">not now. i think it's a bit overblown. the media loves doom and gloom. it gets them clicks. i do think it is going to disrupt jobs, and that may escalate quickly over the next few years as they use ai to make... better ai. spend some time learning, but i don't think we need to be scared yet. they are going to, and already are, jobs that are going away. if you spend a few hours a week playing with things like chatgpt and doing some research, you will be ahead of the game. use ai to create that excel script or aftereffects script. use it for an outline of an article you need to write. or to analyze any data. show your job you know how to work smarter with it. it's getting easier, there have been some major improvements latley. if you want, you can check out some of what i have been doing with it, i'm on the creative side of thingsi hope this is ok mods let me know if not. here most of that was just talking through the idea with the ai. like i would with a human, although a bit more concise and iterating for a while.</data>

  <data key="d1">sys admin here. the honest truth is that ai will be replacing jobs at an increasing rate in the next 25 years. that's inevitable. it will be the document processing, data analysis, content creation, assistant and financial type roles most at risk anytime soon. i would highly suggest you embrace it as soon as possible. learn it. learn how to use it to your advantage. learn how to use it to teach you new skills. i joined a new company about 6 months ago and literally every member of the it department are nearing retirement range and have been in the field for at least a decade longer than me and yet i am miles ahead of them in my capabilities and knowledge. main reason is that they have just sat around doing the same shit for the last 10 years avoiding challenges, not bothering to learn new skills or be proactive, and i literally use ai to some degree every single day. i still see them wasting hours and hours per week doing things in the most inefficient ways possible. manually checking the health of 20 virtual machines... trying to do asset management on an excel spreadsheet for 1000 users... manually setting up laptops out of the box 1 at a time... i could go on for an hour listing processes they have just because thats just how we have always done it. processes it took me less than a week to automate for myself. automation i tried to bring to them to show how much more efficient and time saving it was but it was the equivalent of showing a caveman fire for the first time.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi friend....i had my first panic attacks when i was 20ish....managed with sertraline and clonazepam for a while and just continued with sertraline. fast forward 20 years later today... i'm having panic attacks again because i weaned myself off sertraline. i didn't understand how well it was actually regulating me. i thought i was just taking it to not have withdrawls and boy was i wrong. i jumped right back on it but i'm still feeling quite anxious and scared for no reason. but it will take a while before it kicks in again everything you described is a typical panic attack...the tingles...can't breath...the feeling like something is wrong . it really sucks and i wouldn't wish anxiety on my worst enemy. but fortunately it's your brains natural defense system being over worked and activated at the wrong times and you won't die or go crazy. lately anxiety and panic attacks have been happening when i've been alone....if i'm with people i love it's a lot better hydroxyzine helps me so far...i was prescribed it recently and it does calm my body down a bit so that my day is tolerable. i also take propranolol for my heart when it races.</data>

  <data key="d1">i had my first panic attack this past summer on my way to work. had no idea what was happening... jist got tunnel vision and difficulty breathing so i pulled my car over and got out because i was so scared. went to the er did and ekg and some blood tests and everything was pretty normal. they gave me an iv and said i was dehydrated but it wasn't that. i had plenty of fluids amd went back to another hospital that same weekend since i still felt so off. got a ddimer to check for clottong in the lungs and nothing. got a scan of my heart and cardiologist said i was good and recommended therapy. i'm on the path to recovery but some days anxiety still gets the best of me. i know it won't be like this forever but man... it's harder some days than others. just know that you'll be okay and don't let it take over your life.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's funny how different forms of anxiety can produce such different symptoms from one person to another. mine came out in the form of self hate and self sabotaged myself into almost losing my marriage and my family. i was convinced i needed to be alone to the point of moving out of my home with my super supportive husband, who did not deserve that. thankfully, i learned how to turn it around, i had enough and i wasn't gonna live like that anymore. so i've been working with people lately developing a course to teach people how to overcome anxiety. it's in the beta stage right now, trying to get it to be the best it can, so it's heavily discounted. if you're interested i can give you more information, just message me. or do the same if you ever just want a distraction and want to chat. hopefully you find what you need to help yourself. best wishes!</data>

  <data key="d1">i can only relate a little. my anxiety wouldstill kinda does affect me to where i cant eat. i wouldnt eat full meals or more than a little bit. i wouldnt be able to smell food, if i smelled food i would gag and go to throw up. if i ate too much or too fast i would throw up. my stomach would hurt because of how hungry i was, or just because sometimes. its not uncommon to have stomach issues bevause of anxiety. the doctor says its nothing to be concerned about, so i wouldnt worry too much about it being a health issue. if you truly truly have a feeling that its not just anxiety then maybe stay cautious. but sometimes, especially with anxiety, if you worryfocus on something enough it will manifest itself.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes! its been going on for 3 years since my first panic attack in 2020. anxiety affects my stomach badly. i have bad reflux problems which take meds for and it doesn't help. i get stomach aches daily and it can go all day. it's mainly the upper stomach with the burning and pain and gas and discomfort and nausea. the more things i have to do, the more anxiety, the more it affects my stomach. anytime i have to go somewhere i worry whether i'm going to be feeling unwell. i don't have a job at the moment because of this. there was one week when my stomach issues disappeared. thats when i moved into my parents house for a week when my partner was away and literally had no life responsibilities. when i went back to my normal life all the pain and sickness came back. diet, probiotics, natural supplements haven't helped.</data>

  <data key="d1">from my side, i get a lot of stomach gas and it makes a lot of noises mostly from the left side. when it happens, i can even feel like my left chest gets a little discomfort, a bit hard to explain. i always feel tired, my lips are dry quite often. i went to the hospital like 34 weeks ago because of a panic attack, they checked my blood, urine and even my organs like lungs, heart, stomach. i have an appointment on 19th dec because im convinced i have something else but that wait is killing me. those type of symptoms get worse at night or when im not working so i have nothing to focus on. the winter have just began and its always like that with my anxiety, i hope its nothing concerning my health. i am 21 and i was on a trip this summer which i was walking 2030km a day without a problem but since the beginning of my first panic attack, here are other symptoms i have. heavy feeling on my head chest pain on the left side and on the stomach left side as well urinate often but not a lot loosing the appetite lastly headaches sometimes with weirds sensation inside my ears get cold easily</data>

  <data key="d1">so what does it feel like to you? for my sister for example, she just panics and gets a fast heart rate, heavy breathing, and she gets really upset. for me, i feel freaked out and i get a really heavy body load, i get hot, and my upper stomach maybe 4 inches above belly feels not good and nauseous. i also get fast heartbeat. my sisters seems more to be more mental than physical in terms of symptoms. i also get hot flashes as well. is it similar for you? i also constantly have a bp of 16595 as a 23 year old, and i had multiple other symptoms that have since went away doctors called me crazy for real kidney pain, bladder pain, pressures in different areas, enlarged lymph nodes which are not ever caused by anxiety, and more.</data>

  <data key="d1">i actually have an exposure planned for this evening so ill write about how my symptoms have been so fa it feels today. tmi alert, by the way. since i woke up ive had lowlevel nausea, bubble guts, and stomach cramps. i had diarrhoea this morning. had to force myself to eat breakfast and lunch. as the exposure draws closer the symptoms are getting worse. before i leave, ill feel sick to the point of dry heaving, and the crampsgas pain will be so bad that ill have to be on my own and lay down. when its time to leave, like shoesandcoaton, door open time, all those symptoms will still be there but on top of that, my heart will also be racing, ill feel breathless, my mind going 100 miles an hour, and ill start to feel disconnected from my body. over the years anxiety and agoraphobia has caused me so much pain and discomfort, and i actually spent over a year getting tests convinced i had some illness that the doctors were just missing. your mind can really do a number on your body, trust me.</data>

  <data key="d1">cut the work time down into 30 minute chunks wherever possible and reasonable to do so then piss about doing something you enjoy for a few minutes inbetween. most people cannot hold peak attention for a long period of time particularly when it's something they'd rather not be doing. a secondary benefit of the above is that you are solidifying the notion of doing the work with things that derive pleasure so you'll be more likely to want to do the work and therefore do it more productively and to a higher standard.</data>

  <data key="d1">op talk to your doctor about lyrica pregabalin. it is like a benzo in terms of reducing physical symptoms of anxiety but is nonaddictive. although you may find yourself loopy on it. i would also try art accelerated resolution therapy. it is a therapy that has a trauma focus but there is a lot of crossover with physical symptoms of anxiety. i also would try integrating more exercise into your routine and a more strict diet. i also would consider mirtazapine remeron as it is one of the few drugs with less sexual side effects. erp therapy also works really well if you have exhausted all options, as well as biofeedback.</data>

  <data key="d1">hm. what does she think about the levels of anxiety you're experiencing now? i'm not a therapist, but i guess it seems there has to be a balance between your life quality and therapeutic techniques. also, this seems like a really high level of anxiety to be dealing with every day. can you really effectively engage with therapeutic techniques when the noise of anxiety is that high? or, if you consider going the nomedication path, could you ask your therapist for when you might expect more tangible results? do you think therapy has been effectivehelped you? if not, maybe it's time to look for a new therapist. that's the nice thing about cbt it is actually supposed to have tangible and practical results.</data>

  <data key="d1">breathe slowly and steadily. don't force yourself to take deep breaths, just breathe slowly and steadily. when you're anxious, your body goes into fight or flight mode, which causes your body to focus on essential survivor actions like prepping your body for a fight!, and diverts attention from nonessential activities like digestion. that's the reason you feel sick to your stomach when you get anxious. by slowing down your nervous system by taking deliberate, controlled breaths, and riding the wave of anxiety it will pass on its own time you can bring your body back to equilibrium, which should help your nausea.</data>

  <data key="d1">meditation like some have mentioned could help you from spiralling in your anxiety. medication like someone mentioned as well. however, neither are longterm solutions. therapy would be the best way to go, but depending on where you live it could be costly or inaccessible. if you're unable to access therapy i'd suggest first of all figuring out what it is that is making you feel this way. you sound overwhelmed understandable! but what is overwhelming? write a diary, try to describe what it is you're feeling and what your thought process and emotions look like. if you write something down when you feel really bad then you can look back on it when you feel better and perhaps see it in a different light, and by doing that you can come up with coping mechanisms and ways of stopping yourself from spiralling. to solve the problem you need to find its core. another suggestion is to talk to people close to you. perhaps they can give you perspective on things or help you work through your thoughts and emotions. if you have no one to talk to then i, even more so, recommend writing a diary. getting your worries and feelings out of you and down on paper might make you feel lighter, it at least will enable you to understand what it is you're feeling and why by coming back another time and reading what it is you have felt in the past. when you know why you feel the way you feel you can start working on stopping yourself from spiralling, no solution will work if you don't know what is making you spiral.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've been dealing with the exact same thing as you recently, it's the worst. not sure if this will be of any help, but the heart and human body in general is incredibly resilient and doesn't give up easily. do you know if your friend has any congenital heart issues? that's usually the reason behind heart attacks at a young age, otherwise it's incredibly unlikely. if you really think the ecg might not be enough, talk to your doctor and see if they might consider any other tests. i think the fact it's been going on for a few days now is a good sign if it was a heart attack or you were in imminent danger, it probably would have gotten a lot worse by now. remember anxiety can cause painpressure and tightness in the chest too! there are many different causes for chest pain, despite what the internet says, and only one of them is a heart attack. if you need reassurance before your ecg, look up chest pressure or chest pain or any other symptoms dizziness, shortness of breath, etc with anxiety on reddit, its quite common and i find it calms me down a bit knowing anxiety causes it.</data>

  <data key="d1">health anxiety really sucks. im glad you have been going to the doctor for some tests to rule out health issues. did you have your thyroid checked for hyperthyroidism? once youve received the results of the tests it is important to believe them, and to believe in the fact that health practitioners are looking out for you. its common with health anxiety to doubt the results i went through this too!. for your diet, itll take time to gain the weight back in a healthy way. try putting nourishing foods in your body. use proteinnutrition powders to bulk up on calories and vitaminsminerals. perhaps try to drink more juicesmilks and liquids with calories? itll come in time. sending you virtual hugs.</data>

  <data key="d1">i am right there in the same boat as you. i have always been thin. my entire life i was a rail. no curvesnothing! i would eat and eat and get so mad when people would say things like eat a hamburger..you look hungry. so fast forward to my late 30s, very early 40s. i started gaining weight slowly and loved every ounce! i loved how clothes looked on me. i was finally comfortable in my own skin. then it all went to shit. my health anxiety reared its ugly ass head after losing my father, brother and mother all to cancerwell my mom died from stroke complications after colon cancer surgery, but same thing within 3 years. so now i get twinges and minor little pains in the areas that she used to. i got my first colonoscopy in feb 2020 but now scared i have colon cancer. my appetite has been affected due to my anxiety. so there are days i either dont get much of an appetite or i get hungry but dont really eat much because of that anxiety. i could tell that i lost weight. then i start panicking thinking my weight loss is from cancer and not from not eating. i have since started eating regularly again and dont really see a difference. im hoping that stress and anxiety are the culprit. i did read that anxiety can affect appetite and cause weight loss. so fingers crossed for the both of us fellow worrier. may 2024 bring you good health and calmness.</data>

  <data key="d1">here's what i went through... you will show up at the courthouse with a hundred other people. maybe less. probably more. they might tell you to leave your phone in the car before you show up. in my case, they waited until we were in the lobby to do so. they will make you wait an unnecessarily long amount of time in the jampacked lobby. then they will call you into the courtroom and assign you numbers. they will once again make you wait. this is to see who might get physically impatient looking at their watch, fidgeting, stuff like that. at least that was my take on it. the judge enters and the process begins. both the prosecutor and defense attorney will introduce themselves. they will select potentials at random and ask questions that pertain to the particulars of the case. mine was drunk driving. have you ever lost a family member or loved one due to the recklessness of an intoxicated driver?. if the answer was yes, then the defense attorney ask that you be dismissed potential bias, that sort of thing. if no, more questions. from there it's a back and forth between the two sides and if both are generally happy with your answers then you might get selected you won't know until every potential juror has been questioned. this can and probably will go on for hours. you may never get called on. if you do and they like your answers and get you selected, they will wait until all of the jurors are selected then ask if any of you have any medical conditions that might prevent you from serving and if yes, have you discuss it semi privately with them andor the judge. you can also give them an unsatisfactory answer during the questioning process and get dismissed that way. in my case unfortunately, i was never called on and i was still selected as an alternative. i assume it was because of my patient demeanor through the whole process. if you get this far and chances are very high that you won't, they will set the trial date, you give your employer notice, show up to court, and depending on the nature of the case, you may be just there for a week or two, or if it's more serious, it might be a couple of months. they provide lunch and reimburse you. i don't remember how much, maybe like 50? my employer also paid me on top of it so i came out ahead. your employer should do the same but i don't know if that's a guarantee you'll have to check with them obviously. keep in mind, the process might be a little different depending on your state. it could be more convoluted. hopefully more streamlined. because of covid, they may have called on fewer potentials andor have social distancing protocols in place. best of luck.</data>

  <data key="d1">the other commenter gave a pretty good outline of the process. just a few points your employer cannot legally hinder you from serving on a jury. they cannot penalize you for not being able to come in. on the flip side, if you're not excused by a judge, you must attend. check with hobby lobby on their policies for paying during jury duty. i'd check with hr or payroll. if they won't pay you, you should be able to cover with pto if you have it. as the other poster said, you get paid for jury duty, although it's not much. law and order is not representative of typical cases. there are a number of cases that are relatively simple and only take a day or two. i was called into a courtroom once for jury selection. it was a sixperson jury, not twelve, and they were satisfied with the selection, so i wasn't even an alternate. the trial only lasted one or two days i found out later they had a hung jury. it was a dui on prescription meds case. it's not a guarantee that it won't be long, but it may not be as long as you might think. be honest with the judge, if you get that far. they need people to serve on juries, but they don't want people who are going to be uncomfortable. if a case really makes you squeamish, tell the judge. i've not sat in a jury. my oldest roughly your age did a grand jury. you'd likely know it from the summons, so yours is probably not a grand jury summons. but as the other commenter said, you've got a lot of steps to cover before you're facing a jury box, at any one point you can be dismissed. take it one day at a time, one step at a time.</data>

  <data key="d1">at home grooming is a great option but we prefer to have it done professionally so they can shave around the face and the... more tender parts. long butt hair on a dog is a nightmare. cleaning crusty butt poo that's entwined with hair is an experience i wouldn't wish on my worst enemy! yuck! lol. we are also afraid to cut their nails too short and hurt them. plus our groomer is a fantastically, sweet lady who also cleans around their ears and actually trims their ear hair and checks for signs for infection and needing a vet visit. it's super important to keep their ears clean and the inner hair short when you're working with similar breeds. flat ears can get infected so easily because they hold in moisture. but i'm rambling! sorry!</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel exactly the same way, and i'm willing to bet its a major cause of anxietysocial anxiety. i get intuitive but then extremely selfconscious. i'm not really sure how to classify my anxiety but it almost always stems from these feelings. it's really hard because i love animals and i get it with them too, lol! i'm a dog groomer and it helps and hurts with dealing with animals and people. it's something that needs to be harnessed into mostly a good thing. used to take an ssri, actually tried a couple of them, but now i just take the smallest dose of ativan as needed, it just tones things down for me. my ability to socialize without constantly analyzing everything on the ativan is really nice, but i make sure not to use it often, it can be fairly addicting. it sounds clique but selfhelp books and self reflection really helped me, i read a lot and have come to realize i'm not alone. it's important to leave yourself open even when the empathy part feels very uncomfortable or you won't be able to use your gifts.</data>

  <data key="d1">absolutely! i myself am an anxiety person. when i was 16 i was babysitting, because as much as i hate having to be around people, with kids it was easier. i don't know where you live, but there are always local art stores. i would advise to stay away from corporate and chain stores. they have so many rules and in case you ever have a day where you need to take off from work because of anxiety or depression, they are less likely to be understanding than a family run place. do you live in a town that's large enough for you to do pet sittingdog walking like i mentioned earlier? my mom is a professional dog groome sitter and from about beginning of summer to february shes busy since people are on summer vacation, then thanksgivingchristmasnew years. you could also start creating a profile for hai doing it on yourselffamilyclose friends and even think about doing make up for events such as weddingsparties. edit i have to add, you are still young, so don't be afraid to explore and try out different jobs, you'd be surprised at what you're capable of. as socially awkward and socially anxious that i am, i found that waitressing came really easily to me since it was minimal contact, just had to be nice and smile.</data>

  <data key="d1">i used to be a dog groomer and i described the look of every chihuahua that came in as the chihuahua face of sheer terror. when they didn't like something they just had that wide eyed look of terror and froze solid or tried to bite me. usually once you soothed them they were super sweet and cuddly, though. i personally like big dogs better, but how much some small dogs love being held is really endearing.</data>

  <data key="d1">i got nocturnal panic attacks when i started zoloft. completely out of the blue, had never had them at night or in the middle of the night before. what helps me is to turn on my wax warmer for a nice scent and a lamp and do some reading or sudoku. i find that that calms me down and the light and scent help add a nice mood</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm 34 and i still don't have my license. my whole family attempted to teach me how to drive. my mom, my dad, my uncle. it failed horribly three times. the driver's ed class was a disaster. it all culminates to my fear of other people on the road and i can't trust any of these drivers because they're all either too fast or too reckless. and then i worry about myself, if i can react fast enough. what if i go too fast, too slow? what if i break the law? etc, etc. i was on the verge of wanting to try again in my twenties and then a truck tire blows out right beside my window and that just went all to hell.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's a good idea to rule out other causes but i would say it's possible for all those symptoms to come from anxiety alone. i hate having trouble breathingforgetting how to breathe. i've dealt with it for a long time but still sometimes start questioning if it's just anxiety. but it's a real illness and can cause worse symptoms than a lot of people might think. i'm sorry that you're dealing with this. i know sometimes i'll make a lot of progress and then have a setback and it can be so frustrating. do what you can to take care of yourself whether that's seeing a therapist or doctor or letting yourself hide from the world sometimes. sometimes it's something really stupid you don't think of like caffeine. or think through if there's something going on in your life that's adding stress. try to remember it's not going to stay as bad as it is right now.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes this is common. i'm sorry you deal with this. i have severe anxiety too, and you constantly worry. i always worry that something is wrong, that i'm going to die and leave my little one without a parent this got real bad after his dad died at a young age unexpectedly a couple years ago. i'm afraid to push myself physically, i always feel like i've been hit by a truck. i have effed up sleep and dietary patterns, i look like shit...it's a viscous cycle. it doesn't help that i have lymes disease, which i believe makes the mental and physical issues even worse. you can maybe try changing your diet. i know that cutting caffeine and any type of stimulating thing helps. i also just started a very healthy diet that eliminates all processed sugar and junk. im thinking if i get my body healed, i'll feel better and i won't have as many physical 'symptoms' to stress over. try to find good therapy and get medication if needed for the time being. maybe learn some relaxation techniques like meditation, take relaxing baths, use essential oils and scents in your home as they can create actual changes to mood...</data>

  <data key="d1">it sounds like its probably from your anxiety. ive had similar problems that have only recently got better. i was experiencing all different types of chest pains having the exact same thoughts about heart attacks, pes and cancer. its so awful because the pain is so real and you are told to always take chest pain seriously, but then its like when you tell doctors theyre just like ehhh its probably anxiety. its a shitty feeling but we have to trust their judgement because im sure they see this kind of thing more than we think. ive had the ekgs and chest xrays and im actually waiting on the results of my ct scan fingers crossed theres nothing and its just anxiety haha. i havent been put on any meds, but its a constant thing i consider because ive heard that really helps the random pains go away. i started taking ltheanine over the counter supplement and its really helped reduce the random pains so it might be worth a try. i would see the cardiologist to be 100 sure youre fine, but after that just always remind yourself how sure the doctors are that youre healthy! you should definitely try to get healthier though. i know going to the gym, trying to eat healthy and getting good sleeps really also does have a big impact. i hope it all gets better!</data>

  <data key="d1">thankyou for repkying, i have seen 3 doctors, had numerous people tell me online that it is anxiety but it is hard to grasp as being someone who never felt like this to one day waking up and being slapped in the face with it. i actually start a weight lifestyle change group next weds for 12 weeks so hopefully i can shed some pounds off before summer but i am scared with the pains in my left side chest, hip and even round to shoulder blade that i am going to cause more damage or may even pass out etc i am still waiting for cardiologist and will be asking them for a echocardiogram at least and maybe even a stress test although i try measuring my heart rate myself granted only using my phone but whilst walking half a mile it peaks at about 130bpm and after about 510 mins of rest it drops to about 80bpm which i dont believe is to bad but i am not a doc. i shall look at ltheanine and maybe add that to the cocktail i am already taking..... stupid how i am fine taking supplements but struggle with pharmaceuticals.</data>

  <data key="d1">what ive learned from years of therapy is that anxiety can easily make different parts of your body feel physical symptoms if you think about it enough. im in a similar boat, worried about my throat and it constantly feels like my throat is swollen. best guess would be its your anxiety, but there comes a point where the anxiety is too much and its best to give in and just have it checked out. im at that point. if i may ask, how long did it take to find and get an appointment with an ent? ive been thinking of finally getting my throat checked out and im told it can take a few months to acfually see a specialist.</data>

  <data key="d1">has this happened before? are there any medication or lifestyle changes? at a minimum it sounds like pent up frustration and it may stem from something beyond file formatting. perhaps that was the straw that broke the whole thing. x200b it doesn't sound like a full blown panic attack but just a complete breakdown due to being overwhelmed. exercise, breathing, and appraising your resources might help mitigate some of the frustration.</data>

  <data key="d1">as someone who experienced and ignored this throughout my entire school life, trust me on this and just speak to your doctor about this. which probably means telling your parents first. when i told my doctor, it's not like they threw me in the crazy house or anything, they just took small steps. i was prescribed a beta blocker to deal with the trembling and panicking. it's not addictive, it doesn't affect your brain, it simply calms down some of those physical symptoms. that alone made such a huge impact for me. i'm not saying you even need medication, my point here is just to start the process of dealing with this while you're young. don't let this shit ruin your whole young adult life like i did. it might be hard to tell your parents or even a doctor but it's worth it.</data>

  <data key="d1">the only other piece of advice i have is that when you end up going to the doctor, try not to downplay it like i get nervous sometimes. rather, tell him exactly the problems you have like you did here. that it gives you uncontrollable trembling, physical sickness, and makes it difficult for you to be at school. this way the doctor will clue in instantly that you are actually experiencing anxiety and not just a teenager being nervous like your parents may be thinking. good luck.</data>

  <data key="d1">in order for you to figure out what is wrong with you then the try to be open to talking with a psychologist. maybe the ones you saw in the past were not the right ones for you but they can never help you if you are not open to accepting help. find one you like and go in there open to being helped. be patient with yourself. it took time to get to where you are and it will take time and work to get to a better place. the mindfulness and acceptance workbook for anxiety may be useful too.</data>

  <data key="d1">benzodiazepines are incredibly addictive and not meant to be taken long term, no question about that. most docs wont prescribe it for more than a few weeks or as needed especially for those with a history of substance abuse. anxiety can certainly be a root cause of chemical dependency, the rates of substance abuse especially in regards to alcohol, weed, and benzodiazepines are much higher among those with anxiety disorders. it doesnt sound like your doctor is misunderstanding your anxiety. you can have anxiety and also have a substance use disorder which it sounds like shes taking into account. im pretty surprised she gave you any at all given how cautious most mds are with benzodiazepines.</data>

  <data key="d1">i also have issues with addiction and some reasons why pyschaitrist are hesitant of giving out xanax scripts is because of the high dependency that comes from addiction and anxiety. in my case, giving me a xanax script would put me at risk for developing dependency or a relapse. plus most psychartic medication come with a black box warning about worsening depression or thoughts of suicide, mix that with benzo and it could be a bad day</data>

  <data key="d1">the most reliable way to beat a trigger is repeated exposure to that trigger. i know it sounds miserable, but exposure therapy has been proven again and again as the most effective treatment for phobias and many other anxiety disorders. i would suggest building up to it. look up stories describing people throwing up. then start looking at pictures. then start watching videos. any psychologist worth their salt can help you, if need be.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes. i actually read an article about this once. its basically when you have prolonged, extreme anxiety your brain goes into protection mode as a defense mechanism. it basically shuts down a portion of your brain. when your anxiety is constant and severe enough, it completely shuts down which leads to people, like myself, experiencing depersonalization all the time.</data>

  <data key="d1">this used to happen to me to a extreme degree early on in my dealing with anxiety. i felt so detached from my body and reality. it felt like i could just disappear or stop existing at any second. i was convinced there was something seriously wrong with my brain. on another note, i took zoloft when i first started experiencing panic and anxiety and in the end i had to stop taking it because it made me feel so psychotic and intensified my derealization ten fold. thats just my experience though so dont make any assumptions about your medication based on someone elses experiences. as the years have gone by ive had to deal with derealizationdepersonalization less and less when it comes to my anxiety. i can still get it but its usually only if i am very very overwhelmed to the point of feeling like ive lost control. another odd thing ive noticed is that it seems to be the worst on overcast days where it is cloudy but still bright out. odd i know, i think for whatever reason that this type of lighting just overwhelms my senses.</data>

  <data key="d1">i remember the very first day this happened to me almost 4 years ago and i feel like ive been that way ever since. its weird, but life kind of adapts around it. i feel like effexor brought me out of it for awhile but i eventually had to quit taking it because of my drastically changing reckless personality now i kind of appreciate it to be honest. i know my brain kind of does this so that my panic attacks arent so bad. there is a lot of effort that has to go into retraining the way your brain thinks about this situation, and for me it started getting better when i realized i had to stop dwelling on the thoughts that told me life isnt even real or this is all just some simulation. look into cognitive behavioral therapy! or mindful meditation. they both really help. you will get through this, you are real and sometimes our brains are just a bit confused and thats okay. youll be in my thoughts!</data>

  <data key="d1">yes, i once had a bad experience with too much party and weed , and i really thought i had lost it , to be honest i am really bad at explaining myself but if i can help any one reading this that would be awesome. it took me little more than a year to recover fully, panic attacks came as frequent as daily events some times, i really thought i had lost my mind and work and life became harder and harder. but after months and months of living a relaxing life the most one can relax on that state i recovered fully, its been a little over 2 years now and i can assure u i am 100 of my self again so if any one is in the state i was back then let me tell you i really thought i was a goner on my mental health and now im back 100.</data>

  <data key="d1">not op but the main theory behind depersonalisation and detachment is that your brain believes it is protecting you by taking you away from life for a while. almost like an anaesthetic for the mind. when things are shit your brain wants to protect the valuable areas such as your ego and personality and memories etc so these parts get subdued whilst focusing just on function and survival, perhaps until your mind perceives its safe to be whole again. edit wtf! thank you for the gold! im literally minutes away from going to a view a new house and im super nervous then i got that notification and its totally made me feel awesome again. unexpected, thank you man 3</data>

  <data key="d1">ah, my lovely depersonalization. i have a story to share, might help you. when i turned 25, lot of changes and challenges happened in my life. i was anxious since i was a little kid, but that time it was different. it was shortly after i returned from business trip to uk. i'm anxious traveler and when planes are in the travel mix, i tend to go down fast . anyway, shortly after i returned i had this super strange feeling of not being myself like watching my body to do the daily stuff. i was totally stressed over that and it made me actually sick for a couple of days. then i started to reading a lot. a lot to be honest and that's when i realized my anxiety is problemi never thought of that before, i just assumed that's what i am. that's when i really started to focus on my mental health. i had couple of more episodes of depersonalization, usually lasting from one week to couple of weeks. finally after couple of months i got rid of the most severe episodes due to couple of things i started to do. i'll try to summarize it 1. i needed to realize that i suffer from anxiety. like accept that it's part of me and i need to work on myself to get rid of it. 2. meditation i found lot of youtube meditation videos, like this one which helped me a lot. just do this kind meditation each day and it really helps. 3. try to get out of home early i found out i'm being more anxious and stressed if i don't go out in the morning and instead sitting behind pc. then going out in afternoon or evening, i had anxiety attacks. going out in the morning fresh just helped me to set a good mood for the rest of the day. 4. everytime anxiety or depersonalization appears i just need to realize it's okthis is the hardest part, which eventually i got just about right and i'm now being able to live almost happy life. this is easily said, hardest done 5. don't drink coffee or caffeinated drinks. they are wonderful when one is ok, but can really mess with anxiety and depersonalization. today i can even have 12 cups of lovely coffee each day, but during these episodes i had to give up. 6. sleep is important staying late was adding to my anxiety problems a lot. as a gamer, this is something i had the biggest problem with for me, depersonalization was a blessing and wake up call to take care of my mental health, so i'm really grateful it happened to me. x200b don't hesitate to speak to your close familyboyfriendfriends about this issues. my gf helped me so much with this when i shared this with her. also don't hesitate to talk to people here. sharing stories really helps, you know you are not alone in this! cheers sorry for spelling stuff, not a native speaker.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes, i have not left my apartment once in 2 weeks, i just ordered groceries to be delivered so i will have to today but only to have groceries handed to me. id say my depersonalization is more from depression though. i just play videogames without talking to anyone from the time i wakeup to sleep, sometimes i catch a few online friends to talk to but im on a sleep all day up all night schedule so its hard. i feel like i have no personality anymore and forget im human at times, i really do think being in this apartment alone is causing trauma because ive been living like this for 7 months and need a change soon. luckily i listen to music a lot which helps keep me sane, and the music is nostalgic of the past when i was better mentally and somewhat enjoying life so i get hope for the future when i hear a song that is dear to me. oh what would i do without music</data>

  <data key="d1">depersonalization and derealization are a few of the more, for me, disconcerting symptoms of panic disorder. should they return, my hope is that i will be able to apply some of the tools of cognitive behavioral therapy. i've been fortunate in that i've been able to connect when these symptoms bubble up ironically, they kickoff when things are going well. however, if i'm in a more distressed state then i have no problem with accepting how the world is around me. but when the rent's paid and all seems well, that's when these feelings are at their peak. i've had people, previous therapists as well, write off these symptoms as a simple existential crisis, a consequence for thinking too much that can be easily controlled by focusing on something else. if it were only that easy. good luck, op and the rest of you.</data>

  <data key="d1">this would be classified as an intrusive thought. it's normal to have them, some people have them about murder, suicide, incest, sexual things they feel shame about. it's why every morning driving to work i have a split second of i should drive over the over pass railing. when this happens, my therapist says to acknowledge them as intrusive, then acknowledge that this isn't what you really want to do, and then forgive yourself for thinking them and move on. the intrusive thoughts are normal, but they become an issue when we obsess over them. ps. i'm not a therapist but i get some gnarly intrusive thoughts and have personally had to work on this a lot.</data>

  <data key="d1">pericarditis, infection of the heart sack along with myocarditis infection of the heart. happened three years ago at age 22. also i was in and out of svt arryhtmia after a hike and a lot of drinking, i was in and out of it for three days. pretty dangerous. also super dangerous. my heart was infected in two backtoback installments for a week. i have absolutely no idea and im pretty sure both my cardiologist and pcp are complete incompetents and dont know what theyre doing but have absolutely no idea. my cardiologist did zero follow up after putting me on propanolol, which is quite obviously shitty doctoring, it was my thyroid guy who took me off it, knowing it's not meant for long term. i really shouldnt have replied to your post haha, i'm such a weird terrible example. i just didnt want you left hanging. go see your doctor haha.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah maybe not totally related but anxiety religion made me always feel like i'm eternally bad. i literally had delusions where i thought some nun in church would turn to me and say you have the devil in ye boy. then i always thought that i was in sin even though i was probably the most selfaware empathetic person compared to people i know. always worried if i would see a psychic that they would say something wrong about me or something bad would happen. i basically hate anything religious or spiritual now because i feel like it's all just emotional manipulation and fear based. then there's the normal anxiety thoughts where i thought i was bad because i was in a bad mood. like my actual mood made me think i was a bad person especially around people who were overly critical.</data>

  <data key="d1">so glad to see this thread. for the past weeks or months i go through random periods of tingling in face. i do suffer anxiety. i also had a twitch in my left eye which subsided. and i also have a lot of sinus congestion which i thought played into the facial nerves. the more i worry about it the more the tingling intensifies. and the internet freaks me out. my chiropractor didnt seem concerned and dismissed it as anxiety. much of the tingling seems to stem from the point at the base of my skull around the mastoid process. im going to see my doctor just to keep my worries at bay. has anyone else had further evidence of their anxiety connected to facial tingling?</data>

  <data key="d1">i dont want to pathologise, or diagnose, and its something you should take up with your therapist, but i happened to be this way when i first started having feelings for a person i was attracted to and also felt like i couldnt stop thinking about them, but to an uncomfortable, frightening degree. i later developed very severe anxiety whenever i started liking someone, god forbid be in a relationship with them, and identified perfectly with ocd, purely obsessional. i got a lot of scary, negative thoughts as well as the rush of liking someone, as well as feeling completely incapacitated with anxiety. pop over to if this rings a bell and have a chat with everyone there, at least to have a point to start a conversation with with your therapist about it. again, just my personal experience. alternately finding out why youre so anxious can go a long way to calming it down, as well as receiving medication treatment if you can.</data>

  <data key="d1">new job nerves are very normal, but you need to go in because dealing with not going in down the line would be worse! for the wind problem, take some medication if you have any and avoid anything else that sets you off and try to fart away from people? if the worst happens and you need to let rip, excuse yourself to the toilet. good luck youll do great!!!</data>

  <data key="d1">first, congratulations on landing your new job. second, i have to correct you they didnt give you anything. you earned that position. they see potential in you. they think you are a good fit for their team. they believe that you are well equipped to handle the tasks and responsibilities. they see promise in you. you werent given anything. you earned that job. these people already want to see you do well, and they already believe in your abilities. you just need to see it for yourself. easier said than done, right?? its always nervewracking starting a new job, and youre going to make little mistakes here and there, because making mistakes is part of the learning process. and starting a new job is a major change. if you dont feel like youve transitioned in two weeks or a month, cut yourself some slack. it takes months to feel fully proficient and confident at a new job. im using the word job synonymous with career, not a parttime gig, although there is definitely a transitional period for that, too! tldr when you start feeling anxious, just remember that somebody on that hiring team believes in you. good luck and wishing you much success for your first of many, many days to come</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm about to interview for my dream job, something i'm completely unqualified for on paper, and would be a complete deviation from my current 10 year long career. i'm absolutely terrified of everything. i would be leaving assured lifelong job security for something i could fail at in a few months. furthermore, i would be taking on so much more responsibility than i have right now, considering it's a a management level positionthough i do work a senior position currently. i still feel like a child every day. am i good enough to make it? can i handle the stress day in, day out? probably not, but i don't want to die behind a desk. i could be manic bipolar ii, and this will all come crashing down on my head. but honestly, if i can make it work it will forever change my life for the better. she probably didn't think this would happen, but my therapist told me a few weeks ago that i overthink the cons to every situation i encounter. she asked me to instead focus on the pros, and what could go right. i've decided to take that advice and put aside my fear in order to grow and hopefully be a happier person. i'm curious to see what she thinks of this should i get the job. knowing that someone else is going through a similar situation is oddly comforting. i believe we'll make it, friend. i hope at the very least you do.</data>

  <data key="d1">there is a breathing practice called the alternate breathing practice it is demonstrated like this skip to 0033 mark breathe in through one nostril for 4 seconds or 6 seconds whatever is most comfortable for you, then breathe out from the other nostril for 46 counts, then breathe in from that same nostril for 46 counts, then breathe out from the other nostril and repeat like that for 5 10 minutes it is very calming and can bring your anxiety levels down. do you have lavender essential oils? if you do before your meeting put a couple drops on your collar so you can smell it the whole day it is very calming when you have anxiety. organic green tea has properties that bring glutamate levels down the anxiety chemical in your body so maybe drink a cup in the morning.</data>

  <data key="d1">the worst thing that could happen out of this situation is that your anxiety stops you from getting your job. you can make a conscious choice to confront the situation and accept that you are opening yourself up to have a difficult and anxious period. it's probably going to cause you some short term hardships and a rubbish few weeks. the likely result is that you struggle through and will eventually climb out the other side. you will be stronger, the piece of your life that anxiety has a grip on will be smaller and that grip will be less tight. the other choice is you hide from what makes you anxious and avoid going to the job. at that point anxiety has won the battle and you've reinforced the fact it has the upper hand over you. my biggest piece of advice is this, don't tell reddit about this situation. tell your new boss. you 100 will not regret it.</data>

  <data key="d1">congrats 3 i was in your position too where i was just too anxious to get a job. just going through the application and interview process was a huge win for me. definitely force yourself to go to these meetings. there's, of course, an instant relief from canceling but then there is just constant anxiety and dread afterward when dealing with the consequences. it can lead to you habitually skipping on meetings and that will just cause more anxiety. i've been there. hang in there and trust that it will get easier the more you do it.</data>

  <data key="d1">the best thing ive found for super anxiety inducing situations is to try to mask it as excitement. i tell myself im excited and try to pretend im excited for the event. they are very similar emotions just one is positive and one is negative. think about it. youre getting on a rollercoaster and youre really excited but theres an undertone of anxiety. but for scary things its the other way around. just trick yourself into thinking youre excited because part of you is. you just got a new job! thats an exciting thing</data>

  <data key="d1">it took me about 13 years i'm almost 30 or so to be okay with how i look. i used to think i wasn't much to look at but now i'm like i'm actually nice looking! when i look in the mirror. i think that's due to the maturity that comes with age. i'm a brown eyed brunette, which is a fairly common thing, but honestly, no two brown eyed brunette are the same. my eyes change colors with my moods, the weather, or what i wear, which is cool. they go from mahogany to chocolate, to amber to a reddish brown and that's just cool.</data>

  <data key="d1">i might recommend a different psychiatrist. you scare me because i'm hoping mine will let me get back on klonopin. it was truly my saving grace through a hard time. i'd rather be a zombie than to feel all the feels. i was on zoloft previously. i'm hesitant to start that again because of the sleep issues and sexual side effects. this may be tmi, but masterbation during an attack helps distract me.</data>

  <data key="d1">klonapin has been mine as well which is why i lied to get more in case he does cut it off. i left this out, but before going back to him this time around i went to my gp and he would prescribe it to me as well, however, after the 2nd time doing so, he said i would have to start taking piss tests to make sure that i am the one taking it and he tried to put me on zoloft or one of the others we had already tried. i was like, nope, then called the psych. i have a friend who's psych prescribed her the tabs of klonapin that apparently melt in your mouth or something and hit you a lot faster. maybe i'll call her dr lol</data>

  <data key="d1">i want to second this, and i also want to suggest supplementing a vitamin d as well as a b complex. vitamin d has been shown in some cases to lessen depression and anxiety in sufferers. while there are d supplements out there that are as strong as 15,000 iu, the average person only needs about 2000 to 3000 iu per day. the safe upper limit for long term use for those without chronic insufficiency is 4000 iu per day. a very helpful supplement and also very hard to od on. solgar brand vitamins is an excellent brand, my family's used them for years</data>

  <data key="d1">i also get nausea from anxiety. im actually going through that right now. the whole cant eat because youre nauseous but not eating makes it worse cycle. i eat about one meal a day currently. usually at night when i can relax a little because all thats left for the day is sleep. so youre not alone. ive been to the doctors twice for anxiety and both times werent good experiences because i wasnt transparent. i tried to play it off like it was just stress and ultimately it hurt me. my advice is to be open and honest. be open to medications if thats a route you want to take. the biggest mistake i made was trying to downplay it so i didnt seem crazy. if your doctor tries to downplay what youre feeling, find a new one. you are not crazy and your feelings are valid. as for how to cope, i do breathing exercises as well. it mostly works. lately ive started drawing to distract myself and to calm myself down. do things that require little thinking but a lot of focus if that makes sense. ive noticed watching tv is triggering because i start comparing myself so be mindful of that. anyways i just wanted to say that youre not alone and you will get through this. its a temporary state. your anxiety wont win forever. you can do it!</data>

  <data key="d1">another brit here. i ended up with ibs fro anxiety, so it wasn't nausea but rather the bottom half of things. i went to my gp with anxiety a few times over the years and every gp is different but you just need to tell himher that you're feeling anxious and really struggling with things lately. your gp will know what options there are to help you. something i did when my anxiety got bad last time, i went directly to talking therapies there'll be one in your area. it's nhs run so it's free, you don't need your gp to refer you cause i did everything online. you just fill in a form and they'll get in touch. there's often a waiting list but it gets you on it immediately, cutting out the gp middleman. though i'd still suggest seeing your gp to see what he has to say. to try and keep calm, perhaps write a diary whenever you feel this way. write what's causing it, what emotions you're feeling, write what's happening in a paragraph or two. writing helps me, it slows my mind down as well as distracting me. it puts my thoughts on paper, instead of just in my mind, and i can read them back and help myself calm down. hope this helps! if you have any questions feel free to send me a message!</data>

  <data key="d1">you're not alone. i've been struggling with anxiety since grade 3 now 29 yrs old. for most of my life, my anxiety was caused by a puking in public phobia which was from a traumatic incident i experienced in grade 3 when i threw up in the main hallway, and kids being kids were terribly mean about it. after that incident, each time i'd feel the slightest tummy discomfort i would start panicking that i was going to throw up. the more i panicked, the more it upset my tummy, which caused me to panic more, which in turn made my tummy worse... you get the picture. because i was so scared of vomiting i would restrict my eating to when i knew i would be home for the rest of the day. the anxiety over the years ebbed and flowed some periods of time being more severe than others. my anxiety peaked in university, specifically my final year, to where i was so scared of puking in public that i wouldn't leave my house and was becoming stick thin. it was at this point i finally realized my nerves weren't just nerves, something more serious was going on. my mom pretty much had to drag me out of my house to go to the doctor because even going there was scary what if someone there has the flu and pukes infront of me?? i will definitely puke too, what if i don't make it to the bathroom in time to throw up? etc etc. i told the doctor exactly what was happening. didn't over dramatize anything but also didn't minimize what i was going through. like i saw you mention in one of your replies i think, if you don't tell them what's wrong, how are they supposed to know how to help you? you can't show them like you can a broken arm so you have to explain it to them. they put me on anxiety meds which helped a bit. it was the talking with a therapist that changed my life. he did a lot of cbt cognitive behavioral therapy, journal writing, and worst case scenarios with me. i can now be around pukey people and not panic do i enjoy it, of course not, i don't think anyone really would though. i ended up putting on a ton of weight as i had never had the opportunity to practice self control over eating before since i could only eat a little bit and only during times when i would be home for the rest of the day. now i could eat whatever whenever i wanted to. great in the short term... over 100 pounds later, not so great. now, a few years later, i'm suddenly plagued with general anxiety because i figure, you know, i've already been hyper focused on freaking out about one thing puking, let's now just fear everything. so i've dropped 40 pounds since mid november. since this general anxiety has really taken over, i'm also suffering with ulcer like symptoms. i'm going for a consult and examination to see, but i'm beginning to think it's all in my head. it's all my fear and worrying all the time that's causing my stomach to ache and lose all appetite is what i'm thinking. as of right now, the only way i can possibly eat something without gagging is by smoking a bit of cannabis legal here in canada now, luckily. this also calms my mind a bit too. this, along with breathing exercises and meditation help. i'm really struggling right now though, so am looking for anything that will help. i've been missing work due to panic and anxiety and it's starting to run my life again. i recently have picked up the selfhelp book, dare the new way to end anxiety and stop panic attacks by barry mcdonagh. it has some really insightful information in there that is helping me along. i would suggest it to anyone going through any kind of anxiety. also has an app and youtube page and fb support groups. i really hope your appointment goes well on monday and you can start the journey towards recovery. always remember you're not alone and as tough and scary as it is, it will eventually pass. you're brave. sorry for the super long comment. i gotta get better at being more concise. i hope i didn't lose you. if you want or need someone to talk to, pm me. i would love to chat. best of luck</data>

  <data key="d1">hmmm, well i can do it, but ive never actually tried to do it before. ive never heard of any nerve health test involving being able to tapwiggle just your middle and ring fingers. whats more important in neurology is that you can move all your fingers rapidly, not so much specific sets of fingers... i would say its most likely not that you cant do it, but that your brain has to learn how. did you know many people cant wink only one eye? especially back and forth rapidly? but with practice, their brain can learn to use the nerves and muscles involved separately, allowing them to wink. i think thats probably whats happening in your case. youve never asked your brain to wiggle these two fingers like that before, so its just kind of like, you want me to do what?! another possibly is that youve discovered a physical tell to your anxiety. that is, a subtle physical symptom that warns of an oncoming anxiety attack. with me, its my left thumb im also a leftie. when my left thumb stiffens up and becomes hard to roll in a circular motion, i know a particularly bad attack is on the way. finally it could be that your hand was just tired maybe you opened a pickle jar earlier, or used it in some other way that strained it, causing stiffness.</data>

  <data key="d1">my anxiety has been getting worse lately because ive developed a crush on a new girl at work she has a boyfriend. i dont necessarily think its a romantic crush, i just love being in her company and having a laugh in work. she brightens the day and is great to be around. however, whenever she works in a different part of the building i get really miserable and lonely. i also hate the idea of someone else being lucky enough to be in her company while im not. that sounds like a romantic crush to me.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm a dog trainer. i give lectures and demos in front of up to ten clients at a time and around 1020 onlookers if it's fridaysunday. i don't skip a beat, i can answer everyone's questions, make jokes people laugh at for the rest of the day, and can approach what owners consider to be the most intimidating issues with confidence. i even get told that daily by peopleyou drip with confidence, and when i see your classes it looks like it's spreading. but then i'm off work. let's take last night as an example. my fiance picked me up from work and we stopped for some groceries on my way home. it was the same place 5 minutes away we always shop at. it was the same cashier that typically checks me out at that time on a sunday evening. i've been checked out by him literally hundreds of times since i moved to this area but his small talk just made me go ...heh... yeah... i was really glad my fiance was there because he made up for my awkwardness. i also feel like i get a little burned out by the end of my workweek from talking all day, either to people who want to train with me, current clients, my groomers, or... ugh... answering the phone... and, funnily enough, i have an easier time on the phone with a stranger at work than with my parents at home, and i'm extremely close to them.</data>

  <data key="d1">okay. just remember that its perfectly normal to take things slow. when you meet the right person, you most certainly can work up to sex. you can do up to what feels comfortable and stop. and also remember that not all people are jerks. you dont have to tell someone on a first date that youre a virgin. its perfectly okay to spend time with people then tell them when you feel comfortable. if you think theyre the kind of person to make you feel weird or bad about it, then get out of there! you wouldnt want to be with that person anyway. when you meet a kind person that you like, i think the situation can be tackled slowly and honestly. and most importantly in a way that makes you feel safe and comfortable.</data>

  <data key="d1">read your post several times. your comments about being rejected or mocked reveals a lot about your thought process. you are predicting fortune telling that the date with be horrible catastrophizing. fortune telling and catastrophizing are cognitive distortions illogical thinking and those thoughts are making you anxious. they are sabotaging you. if you go through cognitive behavior therapy, it will change your thinking so you're not anxious. the reality is that some of your dates will make you realize your not a good match, some neither good or bad and some will be great. porn, the media and hollywood make you believe that you can just jump in the sack with anyone anytime. the reality is that most people need to take time to get to know someone. time to build trust and an emotional connection with them. dating is the exposure therapy that you talk about. when you have sex or just get naked with someone, your vulnerable in many ways so you need to emotionally close to them. dating is the process of finding some who likes you for who you are. if you're a geeky guy who likes video games, art, your looks are average and your funny. you need to find some thats like those traits. the really hot guys and gals are probably superficial and shallow. they will marry and probably be miserable, divorced or have a marriage of convenience. the ugly or average looking people are sincere, honest and will more that likely find healthy loving relationships that last. try to see dating for what it is. relax, have fun and take the good with the bad. it's an adventure so enjoy it. you'll have some stories to tell when you get old.</data>

  <data key="d1">the biggest advice i can give is to not to place any expectations on the date. just go out and try and have fun with the person. if the date doesnt go well, thats fine because you didnt expect anything out of it. if it goes well, then thats a nice bonus. i recently got back into dating again after a terrible breakup, and this mentality has helped me a lot.</data>

  <data key="d1">ive been going through the same thing. my biggest fear is losing my mind. ive had to start therapy, i dont want to go on meds. something that helps me a lot, most people who go crazy arent aware its happening and dont have any awareness for their mental health so if youre worried about it youre already less likely to lose it. something else that helps is i tell myself if i go crazy then i go crazy.... worst comes to worst i go on meds and my parents give me three square meals a day and have somewhat of a life, thatd be better than some peoples lifes in the world. you gotta give yourself more credit and get out more and see new things. you wont wake up completely cured but overtime youll start feeling better and not so worried about things you cant control. good luck buddy.</data>

  <data key="d1">ive had sorta the same thing as you although id suffered with panic attacks around a year beforehand. smoked weed a couple of times, didnt feel much so smoked more the next time and had a huge panic attack it was awful. ever since been having panic attacks on and off. unsure if the weed itself was a trigger or maybe im just scared of feeling like that again which is making me panic. definitely recommend to steer well clear of weed, no matter how many people say it can help them to relax if it doesnt sit well with you stay away from it. if your panic attacks are still lingering maybe try and get a doctors appointment and see what theyd recommend to fix the issue. hope it gets better soon</data>

  <data key="d1">panic is a very intense and very scary thing to experience. it's not unusual to develop a fear of experiencing that again anxiety about experiencing anxiety is a very real thing. you can try looking into mindfulness it might help you deal with the anxiety you're experiencing. grounding exercises can also be useful. i don't have any concrete links to give you about these techniques. if you find that you aren't able to control it, and want some help in managing it, i would recommend seeking out a therapist of some sort. they can teach you tools to better cope with the anxiety you're experiencing.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, i hope you're doing a bit better now. it sounds like a lot of your anxiety is related to philosophicalexistential issues a part from the overanalyzing and rumination you mention as well. i used to suffered from severe anxiety for many years i have managed to overcome it and quite a bit of my fears were philosophical in nature. i mention this because i was always drawn to the big questions in life. and if i may flatter myself slightly i consider myself quite creative and not bad when it comes to philosophical argumentation i like exploring these sorts of ideas and finding some truth in those areas. if you'd like, perhaps we could talk and maybe together we can come to some truth or perspective on things that will be less anxietyinducing for you. i can also offer you my perspective and thoughts on the questions you asked here. i could also point you to a method, which helped me the most in overcoming my anxiety it might work for you too. i discovered this method and i haven't seen it anywhere on the internet or in any of the books i read, so i'm also curious if it could help other people. feel free to message me and we can just talk or i can explain to you the method i used to overcome my anxiety, if you want to try it.</data>

  <data key="d1">sometimes it takes time to find the right jobfit in your desired field. don't give up hope! alot of cities, both smaller and larger, usually have young professional networking groups. if your city has one, have you tried finding one of those and getting involved? also, reach out to your school's career center if they have one. they're meant to help both current students and alumni, especially recent grads. even professors in your field of study that you know and trust may know of some open job opportunities within their own network. but seriously, networking is a great way to hear about job opportunities that aren't always being posted online. some of the best schooljob opps that i've interviewed for have been shared with me through someone in my network. best of luck!</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm not really in a place to give advice, but i'm in a similar situation. finished grad school and have been looking for a job in nyc since june. my parents started a business right out of college and don't really understand how the job search works today, and on top of that, they really aren't open or supportive when it comes to mental health. i also definitely understand the dilemma between the sunk cost of college and looking at completely unrelated jobs. x200b if you don't already have one, try to create some kind of support network whether it's friends that are a bit more empathetic or willing to help in the job search or find professional help. i owe a lot to my best friends and therapy. also, when it comes to job applications, always just apply anyway whether you think you're qualified or not. it's easier said than done, but for me, it helps just knowing that i can decline if i get an offer later on. you have 0 chance of getting the job if you don't apply. imposter syndrome is real, and most companies aren't trying to find the perfect candidate that fits every bullet point on their wishlist. x200b it will probably take time, and being a young 20something thrown into the real world sucks. but it will get better. you're not alone. x200b</data>

  <data key="d1">this is fairly common. something a lot of people don't think about or realize. everyone that's alive has anxiety. it's a normal part of life. we are born with different temperaments and some folks are biologically more sensitive to stress and anxiety than others, but once more, regardless of where you fall on this spectrum, everyone has anxiety. for most folks though, their anxiety is manageable most of the time. whether they realize it or not, they have developed coping skills and behaviors to manage their anxiety that works for them. for others with high levels of anxiety and limited coping skills, the anxiety can begin to be either debilitating or cause strange symptoms like panic attacks. panic attacks are generally caused by one of two things. either your anxiety has built up so much slowly but surely over time that you've just reached your breaking point. the way i describe it to clients is to imagine yourself as a steam pipe. all the stress of every day life is pressure that's building up inside you. some days a little bit is added, some days a lot is added. in order to be healthy, you need to be monitoring your stress levels regularly and finding ways to vent the pressure through your healthy coping skills as quickly as it comes in. for folks who don't have a way of releasing the pressure, forget to do these things, or just don't do enough of it, eventually the pipe bursts which often causes panic attacks. a panic attack while feels absolutely terrible is actually a really good thing. continuing with the pipe analogy, a panic attack is your mindbody's version of an emergency release valve. it basically dumps all or most of your reserves of adrenaline at once into your blood stream which causes all of the strange symptoms. anyone who's had panic attacks knows that once it's finally run it's course and it's over with you feel completely drained, and probably a sense of calm you haven't felt in a long while. although we don't know this for sure, i'd be willing to bet if we weren't programmed with this emergency release valve kind of thing, our brains would literally become severely and possibly permanently biologically damaged by too much stress. common symptoms of panic attacks having trouble breathing usually because of hyperventilation, sweating excessively, numbness in the extremities, changes in body temp., racing thoughts, an impulse to fight, flight, or freeze, among plenty of other things. the other reason we have panic attacks is related to fears and phobias. i could write a whole other long explanation but i'll save that for another time. i'm a therapist who treats anxiety disorders frequently and someone who has had more panic attacks than i can count when i was younger. thankfully they're few and far between now.</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you for this comment, honestly. ive have had 2 interviews for important, competitive dream jobs in the past 3 months. they both went pretty okay, and i felt like i was fairly genuine in them, but i was rejected both times, most recently a couple of days ago. ive been beating myself up for failing them, catastrophizing and wondering if im just visibly flawed, awkward, and unfit for these positions despite looking good on paper. you are right though, that the sheer fact that i went to the interviews and that they went pretty well as a bonus is worth celebrating. the grander point here is that anyone with an anxious brain so all of us is capable of beating themselves up regardless of how far theyve come in any endevour. we could manage to land our dream job, but then still get imposter syndrome and constantly think were wasting our companys time. no amount of material success alone is going to make us feel better, so we have to be kind to ourselves every step of the way. even if all you did was apply to a job, that is honestly a huge step for a lot of people. be kind to yourselves, guys.</data>

  <data key="d1">maybe, but if shes professional then i think its a little more likely that youre just expecting her to treat you differently because of the surprise you saw on her face. you might be reading into it too much because you told her a bad thing. she also could be trying to connect this to other things or reanalyzing aspects of your behaviour to see if this changes treatment not basic judging like a nonprofessional. that said, therapists are pretty well trained at managing themselves, but theyre still human. why not ask her next time? see whats up?</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel the same to be honest, ive been seeing a psychiatrist since january so not that long but long enough for him to get a decent idea of what effects me daytoday. but after being honest with him about my outburst, and about how i am etc, along with my hyperactivity occasionally, i get the sense that he is judging me, which im not to happy about as obviously theyre meant to help you but if they judge you about the things you do etc, you end up withdrawing yourself from treatment, and end up not caring at all about the treatment, if you feel theyre judging you, its more than likely your anxiety speaking, as well as mine speaking for me. but if you feel that they are judging you then you can always request a different psychiatrist however i doubt youll get one but you can always ask. good luck!</data>

  <data key="d1">maybe she's just reconsidering options because now you're displaying some traits of other mental health issues. i mean they should take note of it if you say things that indicate some level of narcissism. it could be showing deeper or different kinds of insecurity, or point towards someone having episodes of mania, or certain personality disorders if it was part of a bigger picture. not suggesting you have any of those but just saying it's a trait that would affect their thinking surrounding your treatment. but some people can't put their professional hat on and do let their personal beliefs and issues affect the way they treat clients.</data>

  <data key="d1">i wish i had a magic solution.! when im on sertraline ssri i function pretty well daytoday. i also dont get panic attacks while on it, so that helps immensely and is probably the main reason i can travel alone, speak to groups, and be in places where im uncomfortable. i used to be afraid to drive in strange places by myself because i would get panic attacks while driving the scariest kind!, but while on medication, ive always continually pushed myself just a little out of my comfort zone at a time. to me its always been about just continually doing things that make me nervous, and i slowly get more comfortable. which is only possible because i dont get the panic attacks. my main sources of anxiety these days are health anxiety and social anxiety so there are of course plenty things that cause me a lot of stress, but day to day i currently get by pretty well. i wish you the best and i certainly am no expert, but pushing myself through things that scare me has really helped me more than i can believe...its easier said that done though.</data>

  <data key="d1">im curious as to why youre asking. i stopped taking them about a year ago, but i still have some that are for taking as needed if im having a really rough day. theres no harm in taking medication if its needed and if it is the bestsafest choice for you as an individual. im not sure why you feel like you should be able to ween off it. there is a stigma associated with medication, and for some people there can be side effects, but if you find one that works for you, you should be comfortable taking it for as long as you need it. i had to try a few different ones before i found one that worked. one didnt work, one had minor side effects, one made me feel kinda spacey. but the one i stuck with for 23 years was great. i had no side effects, and i felt like myself. i just felt like myself without anxiety. i just eventually tapered off of it because i was in a good place and it was a hassle, i didnt feel like i needed it. but i would start up again in a heartbeat. i figure...if i had diabetes, id take insulin. i have an autoimmune disorder and i take injections for that. my brain doesnt create the right chemicals sometimes, so theres nothing wrong with taking medication to help it.</data>

  <data key="d1">its a shot of adrenaline. your muscles are shaking from it. ive dealt with this my whole life whenever i have panic attacks. heres what you do i only recently learned this you need to move your body because the adrenaline is there because of your flight or flight instinct. if you move your body and your brain thinks its moving away from danger. what i do is i take a nice deep breath and then i clench up all of my muscles at once that means my leg muscles my thighs, my butt, my arms. i hold them clenched for five seconds and then i release and exhale. do this 3 times and your brain will say ok we are moving... i dont need to send out any more adrenaline. i hope that helps. walking will help your body process the adrenaline too</data>

  <data key="d1">i have had this happen to me with all my adult plans 28m trust me you are not alone! i thought i was the only one who done this. all i ever wanted to be was a soldier but i have applied three times and never gone through with it. i always made the mistake of telling people i'm close to about my plans and they never came to fruition. eg my own inner crictic flared my anxiety and made me feel worthless and stupid for trying. now i am gonna do this and gonna do that man to everyone i know it hurts but its the truth. so now i don't tell anyone almost anything at all. i have been in therapy for 12 months and plan on keeping it going, strengthen your self agaist your own expectation, trying to calve out a huge mark all at once is not the way to build to it. small steps work out what is important to you and do them slowly and expose your self slowly think about all the possitives about your self every day. reach out and talk to someone think about this so this new job, skill, interest or hobbie is awesome to you but you are afraid of what others will think? would you rather be exactly the same and be concerned with others judgments and opinions they will always have them 3 years from now and be exactly the same ? or would you rather have that new skill or job or hobbie. if its important or fun to you then thats all that matters. do it for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes. i used to feel this way a lot. my therapist says you don't have to tell anyone your plans if you don't want to especially if it means you're protecting them your plans from the wrong people. even though we were taught not to talk to strangers, sometimes finding a welcoming online community can help so you find someone supportive to share your plans with. just be safe when talking with strangers.</data>

  <data key="d1">i imagine that one feeling of anxiety triggers your disorder. like, oh, we're doing this? okay, let's do this! if i'm anxious about something i always have to wonder if it's normal anxiety or my disorder taking over. i get anxiety when things end. it's most commonly when i come home from work, since that's what i do more than anything. then it just gets worse and lasts even when i'm laying in bed. maybe it's the drastic change in place? whatever it is, there's no reason for it. if i'm anxious when i'm going to meet someone i'll think about how safe i feel around them. if i know i'll be safe there i might calm down. might. when i'm anxious about nothing i just think, god, i'm so fucking dumb. in a joking way mostly because i know it's irrational but i accept that it's just that way. i'm lucky and i have medicine or i don't even know how i'd deal with it. it is painful in such a way that people don't understand and you can't explain. i'm rambling. i just accept it and do what i can to get through it.</data>

  <data key="d1">benzodiazepine dependence is very serious. it has a tolerance effect meaning that the effects of a particular dose decrease the more you use it. over time you will inevitably need to take more and having a daily habit will lead to the kind of dependence you don't want. you'd end up taking more and more, possibly more than a doctor would be willing to give you. meanwhile, longterm daily use of benzodiazepines leads to inhibited brain function in both long term, short term, and working memory, cognition, etc.. your doctor might agree to let you do this but that doesn't mean it's good for you in the long term</data>

  <data key="d1">benzos seem to work for some people long term without too many issues, but it's apparent that a significant amount of uses will end up in the vicious cycle of tolerance, interdose withdrawal, increasing doses, etc. the long term effects are also becoming more and more known dementia, alzheimers, permanent changes to their cns gaba system of the brain. i took klonopin stronger than valium daily for about 6 weeks early this year. and it really helped. but i just had to go read some of the stories over at the benzobuddies site or even to realize long term daily use is a bad idea.</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel like i might be a bit like your girlfriend in this situation, when i am anxious i cant be held or touched or sometimes even talk to people. i cant really describe why, but its just too much and i end up feeling smothered. i cant give you relationship advice, but me and my then boyfriend now fianc got through it and he understands that when my mental health is bad, im just not going to cuddly or intimate. my advice would be to talk to her, see what help she needs to help her anxiety. if you can have patience with her and work through her problems, chances are she will go back to normal eventually. just dont expect a quick fix and dont put pressure on her or yourself to get the situation resolved overnight. i hope everything works out!</data>

  <data key="d1">well youre not alone thats for sure! happens to me all the time. i always try my best to live in the moment. i tell myself no matter how hard i try, i cannot control the next day or week ahead right now. try distract yourself as best you can. i find it great going to the gym at around 7pm on a sunday night. not only does it tire me out but it also releases endorphins which puts me in a better mood. im sure most people feel edgy coming back to work after annual leave, its normal to feel this way. it could be a possible sense of change in that work place? your tasks have moved on etc? try figure out whats behind that anxiety of going back and try break it down. remember all you can do is your best at any given time. try not to beat yourself up either over feeling this anxiety. its normal and expected.</data>

  <data key="d1">this might sound a bit blunt but sometimes it isn't about making something that's good. it's about being able to make it. every artist has drawn a crappy sketch, every writer has written a crappy poem or story. we all start out at our worst, but the more we practice and improve, the better our art becomes. sometimes it's better to make something that might not be very good than to not make it at all. i know what you're feeling and i've been there before. i think what's helped me is looking at inspiration and then drawing what inspires me. then, at least for me, it doesn't matter so much whether or not it's good, just that i was inspired to do it. i hope that helps you. good luck!</data>

  <data key="d1">your parents are suffering from illogical negative thinking called cognitive distortions. you are correct that they taught you to think this way. now, that you are out of the house you are becoming more positive. when you go back to see them, you now clearly see how negative they are and it drive you crazy. it sounds like you parents are always predicting that something bad is going to happen. these are two cognitive distortions. this kind of thinking is a major cause of anxiety. cognitive behavior therapy will help change your thinking. you can also buy a book called the good mood handbook by david burns but you have to do the exercises in the book for it to work. i think you are going to be ok because you are willing to change. if your parents start talking about your job situation, tell them you are looking for a job and it's not their problem. that you own that problem and you are working on resolving it.</data>

  <data key="d1">i completely understand where you're coming from. i have this as well, both sides of my family parents are divorced. i can ask my mother and stepfather to cool it and they'll understand and back of. my father reacted like your parents and i have not spoken to him months. just to show that this can go 2 ways. i understand that you're frustrated. i got angry just reading your post. but i think you acted too harshly with not much thought. this is completely understandable in your circumstance. but if you want to fix this situation as painlessly as possible for both sides, i think you should cool off for a couple of days, even weeks. don't visit them, tell them you just need some time. when you've calmed down, you should arrange a visit. when it comes to confronting someone over something that they do or did you have to be incredibly careful not go too far and also make sure that they know that they're causing you trouble. a good way to think of this is to push them down and give them a hand back up. my guess is that your parents will think that you resent them and will immediately go into defense mode. so when you begin the conversation you should tell them that you love them and respect them and that they've done many things right. then you let them know what they're doing wrong. you have to be sweet and understanding but also not let them off the hook. let them know that what they're doing is causing you pain. and if they try to excuse themselves then let them know that you understand where they're coming from and why they're doing it but that it's too much and is causing pain. this is quite long but i think that the main point is to let them know, carefully, that they are causing you pain and that you don't want to visit because of this. good luck friend.</data>

  <data key="d1">i understand how you are feeling. i love my parents and they're amazing people, but everybody's got their flaws and i guess sometimes they couldn't measure where to stop sharing or when to act beyond their fears, idk. my mom is super anxious and always worried about things. she raised my sister and me alone because my dad used to travel a lot, so i get where this superprotectiveness comes from. i used to feel her anxiety so much when i was a kid that i remember one day when i was 8 or 9 and she was very stressed out. i remember thinking something like i have to take care of her, but we were raised kind of in a bubble. since i've moved out of my mom's home, i could make a lot of progress with my anxiety. but i still kind of depend on them financially speaking, so there's a lot i still have to swallow, like you. i haven't graduated college yet and my younger sister has, and sometimes i feel like i'm nothing because that's what my dad thinks if you haven't graduated yet you're doomed to be a failure. sometimes we have lunch together, the four of us, and i feel so unfit. i've been trying to set up my own business to have a bigger income, stop depending on them once and for all and maybe move to a city far away for some time so i can clear my head from all the confusing drama in life. x200b and from my experience, i guess talking to them or confronting them so they would treat you differently is not worthy. i've done it so many times with my mom and she has never given me any credit. maybe with you it could be different, i don't know, but i guess you should try to focus on the being independent part, that's what i've been doing even though it's hard as hell. try thanking them in your mind when you have a good moment with your parents, like think about how that made you feel. it'll be nice to help you give less importance to the mean things. i know this is not the best solution, but i'm sure your parents mean no harm, like mine, and they're older than us too and things were way different during their time, so i guess cutting them almost all the slacks is fair. x200b do the best you can so you can feel so happy and proud of yourself that their opinion won't really matter. i hope i could help.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think so. in fact, i think my anxiety was partially caused by my parents as well. so you aren't alone. i think if you are conditioned to think a certain way your whole life, but then you start to question itlearn that's not how you are supposed to act yet your parents continue the behavior it can cause a lot of stress and ultimately anxiety. i dunno if that made sense, it is hard to explain! i'm good at examples so lemme try that parents tell you that you're stupid your entire life. later on, you learn you are actually quite good at a lot of things. people compliment you all the time on your smarts. you make great grades. but your parents continue to say you are stupid, with no basis in fact. this can be stressful! and anxiety inducing! because someone so close to you saying something so blatantly wrong is really hard to handle. it's almost like you are going insane haha</data>

  <data key="d1">yep! this is my mom to a t. what makes it worse if you are crying and it is night time shut the hell up because no one cares go to sleep. work is more important than your mental health. you grow up believing everyone else and everything else is important and take priority over yourself. also add an alcoholic to the mix and now you have an environment that isn't secure. now your mental health and physical health is at risk and the people who are suppose to protect you are the people who hurt you more than the people they protect you from. good job morons you just fucked up your kids before they got to adolescents. of course it is never their fault. it is everyone else's especially the democrats fault for making us believe we are entitled to parents to not abuse us. my brother, sister, and i all suffer from mood disorders. different ones. x200b okay back on topic, don't talk to them. if you decide to, talk to them once a month. tell them if they want you to call more have more respect for you and herself and stop playing the negative game because it is bringing you down. show some god damn empathy you sack of shit parents. we are not perfect we have problems too you don't have to remind us. also, do not talk about your problems to them. do not share anything that is wrong because they will keep up the negative problems. instead talk about something positive with them or something you saw on tv. no more talking about problems to parents they sound like they have no empathy. x200b also, go see a therapist that specializes in child abuse. try meditation there is a phone app called headspace that can help. x200b oh yeah before i forget, you are an adult now you don't need to listen to your parent's bullshit and you can eat doritos in the morning if you want and sleep as long as you like, you can also get any job that you can get. even crappy entry level. hey it might suck but it is better than no money. money gets you doritos for breakfast. money good.</data>

  <data key="d1">i am not denying drugs can cause temporary or even permanent brain damage such as you're describing, and i actually know all about it myself. i think drug users play down the potential of brain damage because it sounds scary, but addiction, withdrawal and post acute withdrawal are definetly related to brain damage, whether it's natural production of chemicals being halted, receptor damage, or whatever else is possible. that being said, are you sure these issues weren't there to begin with? i mean, perhaps your drug use was self medicating anxiety for years? mine certainly was, even although drug use, or more spesifically drug withdrawal, did make it worse...</data>

  <data key="d1">i get the gags. and weirdly, a runny nose. happens in the morning almost exclusively. waking up early? yep. feel nauseous? yep? i can't swallow my morning meds due to the gagging. do you take any meds for anxiety? i have a xanax rx for emergencies, that i can take early, that offsets a lot of the morning struggles. deep slow breaths help me too. have you heard of a 4sided breathe? inhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, exhale for a count of 4, and wait for the next breathe for a count of 4. for me, in the past, this has steadied my thoughts and taken away the fear of throwing upgagging from the forefront of my mindconcentrating on something i can control you are not alone, and everyone who reads this understands the struggle you are dealing with. we are with you.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi there, i have the same issue. i got dumped 2 days ago because over the course of our relationship, if he didnt message me for 8 hours i would go into hysterics. i would have thoughts that he was dead, that he would be incarcerated, or other extreme situations. i would worry myself so sick that i'd become suicidal, harm myself, or do drugs. it became too much to handle for him after so long. which, i cannot be mad about. i understand him. we are still friends however and are still on very good teems. i realized the day we broke up that i have separation anxiety. the same reason my other ex left me was because of this. ive been looking at treatments, because i am already on anti depressants. cognitive behavioral therapy and anxiety medications seem to be the main things that help. but medication is not a permanent solution, merely treating the symptoms and not attacking the root issue. therapy is your best bet if you have access. the reality is, your boyfriend will not put up with it forever. it becomes exhausting to the other person, it causes them to feel like they cannot relax, and stresses them out. you still have time to begin working on it. i relate to a lot of what you're feeling. i know it feels like you aren't in control sometimes, but you are. you can start working on this. you are not alone.</data>

  <data key="d1">it sounds like something similar to separation anxiety to me, as the connection between you two, while not severed, is made weaker during these times. that thing that makes some dogs howl like the world's ending when their human leaves, or chew things they shouldn't. it's pretty pathetic in dogs and needs to be trained out of them, and i don't see it much differently when it comes to humans. while she might aww or otherwise baby you and insist she's glad you told her, nothing would actually be accomplished by doing so since it's not something she has control over. all you'd be doing is revealing weakness and perhaps make it worse, as she might try to cater to you and baby you more prior to leaving something humans sometimes do out of the goodness of their hearts but which actually makes the dog's problem worse. a lot of women would see it as clingy and can be turned off by excessive weakness. even if we ignore that entirely, there is no need to share every weakness with someone just because we trust them. save some secrets for later.</data>

  <data key="d1">i would recommend therapy, especially since you battled depression in the past. you are right, you have nothing to worry about since you trust her, so it may be that you fear losing her. you can tell her if you choose, but then also choose to do something about it as well. you don't ever want to be too dependent on your relationship. it's not healthy. good luck!</data>

  <data key="d1">have you took anything specifically to relieve ibs? there is a range of over the counter medication or your doctor might be able to prescribe something else if they don't help. if it is frequent it might also be worth looking into the fodmap diet or at least reducingcutting out certain foods like spicy food, hard to digest like beans, carbonated drinks, coffee etc. also a hot water bottle is helpful to ease some of the cramping.</data>

  <data key="d1">take some solace in the fact that you are not the first person to have no idea what they want to study in college. im 42 and still have no idea what i want to do when i grow up. not sure where youre located, but in the us lots of universities and colleges have programs specifically designed to help students figure that out. additionally, typically most of your gened classes are taken during the first 2 years of college, so that gives you a little extra time to see what youre passionate about before really diving into classes for your major. as for your grades, most places have study groups and tutors available to help you out if you need it. also, surround yourself with people that will build you up and not distract you from focusing on your goals. finally, remember to have a little fun. good luck!</data>

  <data key="d1">what i'd really like you to do it to break the process up into steps. as small steps as you possibly can. for example, i'd like you to download the application form. that's enough. just see if you can do that. if you can do that, i'd like you to open it. it's ok if you need someone to chat with you while you do that. i can be online while you do. once it's open there's no harm in maybe just filling out your name. if all that sounds like stuff you could maybe do, i'm happy to hang around online until you get that far. maybe reply to this comment if you get that far? oh, and i didn't ask what the consequences are of getting the job or if you could cope with them, or of applying, and neither should you. that's not the issue. the issue is downloading the application form. do that. the anxiety can shut up and go away now, because you're only downloading a form. that's it.</data>

  <data key="d1">that's ok. you don't need to tell he right now. i think it would be really helpful to remember that none of this is set in stone it's all just an intellectual exercise, and you could talk to your line manager about it just like that. you could ask he about he opinion about the role, and if you'd be a good match for it. once you know he feelings, it could be a lot easier to gage your next course of action. personally, i'd be amazed if shehe weren't delighted and happy for you. most line managers most good ones want their team mates to succeed. for all you know there's a chance shehe is applying for another role right now as we speak. it's entirely possible. i'm sure your partner, a friend, or a trusted team mate would be happy to role play out the interaction with you, if you think that might help? remember nothing has happened yet. there's no need to go through with any of this. even after the application is posted you could still pull out and not have the interview. and even if you had the interview you could still turn down the role. none of this is set in stone. it's all just an exercise at this point.</data>

  <data key="d1">i understand. i have lifelong severe anxiety disorder and struggle to cope, and i've had 2 therapists last year tell me not to rebook because they can't help me. one changed the subject when i brought up a recent split from my ex husband who was very violent and abusive... he didn't seem that was necessary to talk about, changed the subject and asked nothing about it, then told me i don't need any more sessions. i have no idea why they acted that way. i am a fairly insightful person who is open to suggestions and different points of view, i did not resist talking about anything and was very open and honest. i was not demanding or emailingcalling them between visits or any possible thing anyone could do in therapy that would be inappropriate or suggestive of not wanting to be helped. always on time, always open and receptive, listened to everything they said. so i don't blame myself. i did at first, thinking what's wrong with me that i can't be helped according to professionals? but i came to the conclusion that they were just worthless at their job. i really neededneed help and it's like i was too complex for them with ptsd, ocd, anxietypanic disorder, substance abuse etc. though they claimed they specialized in some of those things, but i think they just put me in the too hard basket and sent me away when i didn't say i felt much better after 5 sessions. they have plenty more straightforward clients to choose from i guess. one said we weren't progressing even though she gave me nothing to work on or anything, just chatted in sessions. and she spoke a lot, and talked over me, ran over time with other clients and then would bring me into the room late and then wrap it up early, forgot my appointments or claimed they were never made when i had them on cards or put straight in my phone while in the room with her. she texted me a lot asking me to reschedule as well, almost every appointment. still to this day, i haven't even been able to pay anyone to listen to the abuse i went through to my ex from age 16 to 29. they don't seem to think it's important! i thought you're supposed to like unpackage that shit in therapy. if i ever go to one again, there will be no more passive little miss nice. i will straight up tell them what other idiot psychologists did and that i really needed help and was turned away, and that i don't have time or energy to explain my life story over 3 sessions, so i'll tell you it in dot point right now without any speaking from you, and then you can decide right here and now if you're able and committed to actually start cbt or any kind of treatment with me. since other ones said i really need cbt and then never fucking began it and sent me away. i'll go in there defensive and angry, which sucks because i was never like that but the psychologists last year made me feel really hopeless and like i can't be helped at all. i only got angry about it months later, and i actually want to email my last one and tell her how detrimental the sessions were. it's not like i ever expected a dramatic improvement or miracle cure. i just want better coping strategies and to explore past trauma to see if i can somehow release a bit of it.. and just work on changing my thinking... isn't that their job?? if i felt not much improvement and still didn't find what works for me after months of therapy then ok, maybe i'm not helpable or maybe need to try someone else with different approaches. i'm not mad that they couldn't help or fix me, i'm mad that they turned me away and claimed that i was a coping just fine or b not progressing or able to be helped after 35 weeks. i'm going to see if i can leave a google review of them both.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have the same problem too. but please be social for your own child's sake. i grew up with a mother with social anxiety who barely went around her own family and i was attached at the hip to her. once, days before my birthday, i had to beg my mother to call my friend's mothers for a sleep over because she didn't want to talk directly to them. because it was last minute after a major holiday, no one came.</data>

  <data key="d1">its pretty common for weed to begin making people anxious free theyve been smoking for years. likely nothing will really be able to fix this but if youre in a legal state you could always try high cbd strains. psychedelics are no joke, im not really sure what half an acid is as theres not really a standard dose and it can come in many forms, however if youre dealing with an emerging anxiety disorder would think its pretty obvious that you should address it before messing around with any psychs which will amplify your current state of mind. so do what the rest of us do, go to therapy, get medication, practice yoga, meditation, mindfulness. get enough sleep and be careful with alcohol. pay attention to your anxiety and begin practicing how to calm down when youre irrationally anxious. theres no quick fix and itll take work, good luck on your journey</data>

  <data key="d1">it typically takes two weeks for the medication to kick in fully. the body can go a little haywire before this point because your brain is adjusting to the serotonin. hopefully if you just started you have a follow up with your prescriber around the 2 or 4 week mark, which is when you'll have a better idea. if you're very uncomfortable by 23 weeks, i'd call your prescriber.</data>

  <data key="d1">because you're put on the spot with really no time to prepare. due to that, your body starts to go into a flight of fight response. however, because there is no actual danger present, there's nothing to fight or flee from, so your brain gets stuck. pretty much what happens when someone suffers a panic attack. this is a very basic explanation of how i believe this works. i'm just going off highschool bio and general stuff i've heard. might be wrong about some things, but the overall idea should be accurate enough</data>

  <data key="d1">no. the friendships are not salvageable. what they did wasn't out of concern. if it was out if concern they wouldn't stage an intervention. you have a serious anxiety disorder, not an addiction to heroin. if they were your friends, they wouldn't demand that you share your confidential medical information. that's none of their business. they would've made time for your birthday instead of going to bed at 4am the day of. they would never try to take your pain, minimize it, while at the same time magnifying their pain and shoving it in your face. nor would they ever say nobody wants to be friends with you. that's awful. and i'm terribly sorry those sacks of human garbage did to you. they're a bunch of self absorbed pricks who are straight up bullying you. you need to get out and cut all ties with them. there are better people out there, op</data>

  <data key="d1">i read that instagram was starting to experiment with removing likes all together from public view. i really hope they do. there's been a lot of uproar from the influencer community because likes are pretty much currency to them, but i think issues like what you are describing far outweigh it. x200b i understand how you feel, though. instagram and social media as a whole has exploded since i was 17, which was only 7 years ago. 7 years ago, everyone was using the instagram filters only, all the pictures were square. nowadays, people are posting pics that were taken on professional cameras and professionally edited on photoshop, perfectly posed, perfectly captioned. it's not really sustainable for the average user, and it stresses me out. and i can't imagine being 17 and having that as the standard. at least for me i could post crap posts and it was normal and i didn't care, nor did anyone else really. i hope you are able to find peace with it. just know that if it starts to become too much for you, get off of the app. get rid of it. are you still in hs? if yes, i know there's probably some fomo associated with not being on instagram and not seeing what people are up to. but, to me, i always thought it was pretty cool when i met someone who wasn't on social media in hs, or college. people don't judge you for not being on social media. they just kind of think.... huh, how do they do it?</data>

  <data key="d1">sounds like brain fog to me. very common and terrible symptom of anxiety. it can make you feel like youre sleepwalking through life, andor like parts of your brain arent working, or the whole brains slowed to a crawl. i knew a girl who had it so bad she couldnt even do simple math in her head! and she was good at math. dizziness is real common w anxiety too, so you might being having a brain fogdizziness combo that mimics the sensations you feel when about to pass out. try looking up your symptoms on the list at anxietycentre.com they list almost every symptom common to anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, im an undergrad psych student, so heres what info i can offer you psychiatrist in this day and age, they rarely do therapy with clients rather they are the ones people go to if they are looking to get prescribed any sort of medication. psychologist can do therapy, can also administer psych assessments to formally get you a diagnosis for say, adhd or more serious disorders like bipolar or schizophrenia. they can utilize all kinds of different therapies. psychologists are not all the same, they may have different backgrounds or approaches to therapy psychodynamic, cognitivebehavioral, etc. so that is something to keep in mind, some may be more helpful to you depending on what youre dealing with! counselor can also do therapy, and like psychologists, they can have different specialties or backgrounds as to how they conduct their style of therapy. counselors are not like psychologists though in that they cant perform diagnostic testing. and just an fyi, if youre wondering whether to go to a psychologist or counselor, i wouldnt say to get too hung up on the credential. both can be helpful to you and if i were you i would choose the one that specializes in what youre dealing with rather than picking one just because of the credential. if you go to psychologytoday.com and type in your zip code you can find a list of psychologistscounselors in your area and what they specialize in, so that could be helpful. anyways, hope that clears things up a bit! good luck.</data>

  <data key="d1">its what they call a false memory. they can happen. it's how i got diagnosed with ocd. mine involved me thinking something happened like 15 years ago. it took me like 2 weeks to realize what happened. but by then the damage had already been done. some people think they murdered someone, molested or raped someone, etc but it never happened. they'll go back to the scene to try to piece the false incident back together. if there are cameras they'll ask for cctv footage from when they thought the incident took place. sounds like you got lucky. i'd still go talk to a cbt therapist about it. it couldn't hurt. not saying you have ocd. i can't diagnose you. false memories can happen with out having ocd as well. there are stories of people turning themselves in for crimes they didn't commit. it happens in war alot too. but seeing a cbt counselor is the best thing to do.</data>

  <data key="d1">no, our thoughts do not have control of our actions and behaviors. intrusive, fearful thoughts are the opposite of who you actually are and what you would actually do. even though i do not know you, i know that your thoughts are the oppositeof what you would ever do, because they scare you. they are just thoughts. label them as intrusive thoughts when ever they occur and it will help to lessen their strength.</data>

  <data key="d1">there are some differences between people that have intrusive thoughts and those that have ocd. with a diagnosis of ocd, people have obsessive or intrusive thoughts, and then they have some type of compulsive behavior physical or in thoughts that they feel they must do. and this cycle causes them so much time and distress that it interferes a great deal in their life. intrusive thoughts may or may not be ocd, but you would have to see a therapist in person to receive a correct diagnosis. either one can certainly cause more anxiety and distress.</data>

  <data key="d1">i am so sorry that you are bothered by a fearful thought. i cannot diagnose or treat people on reddit, but every person i have treated with fearful thoughts, have always been the exact opposite of what their thoughts were. at first, i think i shared videos on panic. but, the more we talked, i think the playlist on accepting anxiety are better for intrusive thoughts. i will copy you on that playlist. you may especially like the one on visualizations. if the videos are helpful, you may want to subscribe because i have new videos go live every monday, and i have ones on intrusive thoughts coming up in a few weeks.</data>

  <data key="d1">i really feel your son's pain here and i'm at least happy to know how far you're willing to go to help him out. all of the things you suggested about letting him have time away from everything is good. at my worst, i literally could not get on a train for an hour and a half to visit home. my alternative was having my dad pick me up from uni and drive me the three hours back home. also terrifying and horrible. the only way i it through that was sitting in the back alone with headphones and a laptop to watch a movie to distract myself with if i could. i think sitting with him and calmly explaining the only options you have are having him stay home but having to have someone stay with him or come on the trip and make these allowences for him and let him tell you what he needs to feel calmer. let him have some time to really think through which will be best for him and come up with his own terms for what is going to make him feel calmer. of course it will have to fit within one of those two options, but you doing giving him set things he's allowed to help his anxiety may not be as helpful as you think unless it's what he wantsneeds. these are all only temporary fixes though. if he's not in therapy i think he really needs to be. i used an online therapist on a website called talkspace which you can even use from your phone so he could message a therapist wherever he is and whenever he's feeling anxious. they can help with learning to understand and manage your anxiety better. some people would also suggest meds but i've never personally been a fan, but there is herbal remedies you can take that when your anxiety levels are that high can just help you feel that little bit better. also, i think it's important to remember that the chances are on the day of leaving even if he agreed to come, he is absolutely going to have a panic attack and try to back out of it. i would suggest trying to keep this initial step as calm as possible, and have a backup plan ready if he really can't come, but also remember that it's the anxiety talking and if you can bring him down from the panic attack you'll probably be able to get him into the car.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think it was fairly new when i started so i was only paying around 40 a month. that was classed as unlimited messaging so i got to send a message whenever i wanted to and the therapist replied a couple of times a day. the prices changed and they made some new options like video sessions and therapy tuesdays so you'd only talk on a tuesday which was cheaper so i'm not sure how much those are. i just checked and the price now for unlimited messaging is listed at 65 dollars a week. so seems like it's gone up quite a bit. i know there are a few other online sites out there though.</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you so much for your perspective. i was hoping someone who has been in my child's situation would comment. and i like the online therapy idea. i should check into that. so, when you were in the back on the vehicle with headphones on in order to cope, what was going through your mind. what was the cause of the anxiety in the vehicle? my child also has anxiety around everyone, including us. about the only time he feels better is when he's alone. so being in the car with us for hours on end will be hard. i am trying to figure out why that is. we try not to interact with him too much. we give him space. we are courteous. we give him choices. we respect his boundaries. i'm wondering what you think about what causes anxiety still around immediate family or in a vehicle. i value your perspective since you've lived it yourself. my anxiety is so minor in comparison and only tied to certain situationspeople, so i can't fully understand it being so allencompassing. but i want to understand.</data>

  <data key="d1">for me, i was very very stressed at the time and so i was experiencing a lot of physical symptoms. the usual panic attack kinds and also i would be sick every time i ate. this was huge for me even though it seems so minor. it was the idea that i would be stuck in a car and suddenly feel sick but be unable to pull over, but honestly the sheer panic just came from a sense of embarrassment about feeling that way because in the back of your mind you know you're fine, but you certainly don't feel it and it's impossible to explain why you feel that way so it seems so silly. you mentioned your son is also suffering with depression? depression and anxiety and very often comorbid and they kind of spur each other on so to speak so if he's just not feeling great at all that day, it intensifies the anxiety. i think it's important to remember too, that while anxiety and depression can be helped massively by talking therapies and wellness techniques that there is still a scientific explanation in brain chemistry. when he feels anxious in the car around family it's not because of anything specific you do, just that his anxiety is so high in general that having to deal with anything other than being in your own safe space and being left alone feels like an unknown and you just want out as soon as possible. i would say the fact you're doing your best to understand and give him space is great because so many people wouldn't. i would also say, as a very small word of caution, that my anxiety eventually got so bad it manifested into agoraphobia and i could barely leave the house. hopefully your son is nowhere near that yet, but the more avoidant behaviours you create for yourself and allow for yourself the more work you have to undo all of that to feel normal again. the online therapy was great for me, they can help your son with techniques and set out therapy plans for him and get whatever he needs to off his chest and provide a professional eye to help you realise things you wouldn't have before. i would definitely recommend it.</data>

  <data key="d1">no problem, i hope it helps a bit! for me, i think the most important thing is trying to get him to realise that he shouldn't feel bad about feeling anxious and if you can get him to open up more about when he's feeling anxious and explain what little things might make it better like for me, music through headphones and fresh air felt like enough of an escape to regain composure, but horribly rude in a social setting he can start to feel in control of it slightly more. i can understand from both of your sides of view as i went from being, like yourself, experiencing little to no anxiety, to suddenly crippled with it and it was very eye opening. i suddenly saw lots of times when i'd told someone to 'just calm down' and felt absolutely awful. anxiety is one of those weird things where our communication on the matter is hugely lacking and it's so hard to explain to someone that's never felt it at your level what you're feeling. the best thing you can do is hear what he has to say about how he's feeling and do what you can whilst remembering you can't truly understand how he's feeling and that's why sometimes it seems like you're doing something wrong or he's just being difficult.</data>

  <data key="d1">working in retail with anxiety is the worst, especially when you're working the cash register. it's like being trapped for 8 hours. i get so easily flustered and i hate feeling like i'm being visibly off, and coming off as rude or weird. plus, you have to basically bare the brunt of everyone's bad attitudes, even if its unrelated to you it sucks i can go on and on</data>

  <data key="d1">understandable. i'm thinking of quitting my job at a chocolate shop once i start university in the fall. it's been really good for me and in the same ways, really bad. i have good days, where i feel really accomplished and my customers were appreciative of my effort. but then i have bad days, where i'm forgetting everything, my coworkers get a little upset, and i have to work hard in order to not break down crying. living with anxiety is hard. it's good to push ourselves but not to the point of breaking.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know it's easier said than done i literally got stuck as a cashier for 6 years despite sending around 30 resumes at least, but get out if you can. sure, multiple coworkers commenter on the progress i made with confidence over the years. but internally, i was struggling so much. i had quite a few panic attacks working there, and almost every moment i spent over analysing how i stuttered a little or customers called me out on not smiling. one apparently told my coworker i needed to get laid. when your job takes its toll on you mentally like that, you carry it home. i finally got in to admin and i feel a sense of calm i've been missing for so long. some people will overcome their anxiety and that's great. but if you can't, work out your strengths and find a different avenue.</data>

  <data key="d1">as someone with severe social anxiety. working a costumer service job was just the hardest thing. and i never want anyone to see or know that im not ok, so for the firs 2 or 3 months id just be straight up crying for like an hour because of how bad my anxiety would have been. it say i needed to go to the bathroom, when really i was in a full blown panic attack. and because of my social anxiety i couldnt even tell my superior how bad i was suffering or the fact that i really wanted to quit. but i persevered, and it got easier with time. ofc their where some really shitty people and that more often than not trigger my anxiety. but i do not let that stop me from being able to work so i can afford to survive. if it isnt obviously, i hate people trying to take care of me or thinking just because its a lot harder for me that i cant do it, i can do anything even if my whole body is shaking and its feels like im about to die</data>

  <data key="d1">the first time i had an accident, i dented the front of my scooter and the bumper of the vehicle i rammed into. it had been raining heavily... the brakes failed, the vehicle in front of me braked suddenly, and i was so wet my shoes were insufficient to slow me down on the wet path. i burst into tears, the kind of choking panicky messy tears that leak from everywhere. some people from the neighbouring houses came out to investigate. the driver of the vehicle i'd dented came to yell at me, but paused when he actually saw the damage. it was an inch deep at most, on a vehicle that had seen much better days. i'd actually done more damage to my scooter. a couple of the neighbours seemed to understand what had happened and stayed with me till i was okay to drive the rest of the way to work. i was certainly shaken, and i'll never forget it, but it's not the worst accident i've been in. driving is an inherently risky activity, i think especially in india, where i live, and my anxiety is bad enough i don't actually drive cars. you've managed that, and i think that's pretty cool! give yourself some time. nobody's an expert at this right away.</data>

  <data key="d1">can you offer to volunteer for water or help out but not run? tell them youve been having heart conditions and you dont want it to flare up, thats a serious thing and they should understand . you dont have to go into too much detail. say you want to be apart of that event but unfortunately getting your heart rate up right now could be really bad for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">a discreet i am sorry, i was not feeling well enough to run today would do. you can also offer to just voluntee out with the run than participate this year. you have already done so much for this charity run, also last year. don't overthink it too much, as you said the participation is symbolic and it's ok to not participate if you are not feeling well.</data>

  <data key="d1">one piece of advice to is get therapy and medication. accepting that you wont be able to control everything in this world is a good step. also think about it this way, youre worried an intruder is going to come into your house and hurt you yet by constantly fearing that you are hurting yourself. sleep is important, focus on breathing and accepting that your gonna be ok. have a half a banana before bed, good magnesium which helps sleep a lot.</data>

  <data key="d1">first of all your anxiety is legitimate. you are valid, your emotions are valid, and you dont need anyones approval nor do you need to own their disapproval. now, you have a choice here you can indulge your anxietys momentary want to avoid, or you can confront it head on. it will be scary as hell to stare down your anxiety and say, eff you, im doing this anyway. one will leave you with long term regret and the other will be uncomfortable, but give you something to be proud about and will help you long term. look at it this way, yes youre going to be anxious. yep, you might not get the job and they might be total douchebags. but, in the grand scheme of things you can say that youve accomplished something major you felt the need to want to avoid a problem and fought back. that is such a major hurdle and its already something to feel proud about. the more interviews that you do, the less scary it will get! stripped right down to the core they are just conversations! theyre sometimes hard conversations and we psych ourselves out over them... but theyre just like chats with any other stranger. theres a lot of really great prep tips on the internet for your next round of interviews. some communities even have employment counsellors that will do a mock interview with you</data>

  <data key="d1">just so you know, i was one of those typical guys that didnt understand what anxiety really was or meant to people. are used to say stupid things like people who cant deal with their mental problems are weak. well guess what, now im in one of those situations where i have anxiety. sometimes setting the person down that you care about and explain to them what youre going through without holding anything back will help the other person i understand. i told my current girlfriend about this problem since it recently started and she was super understanding and has been super patient with me which makes things easier for me whenever i have my little episodes. i try to look within myself to make myself happy, but id be lying if i said it doesnt put a smile on my face whenever im feeling like shit and my girlfriend does something to make me laugh or holds me or just lays next to me on the couch to watch a movie or something, it puts all my stress at ease. keep your head up and remember you are worth more than youll ever know.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey i'm really sorry that happened. it sounds like it might have been a panic attack. do you get panic attacks? i know that when i get panic attacks, i get very light headed and i pass out. i also start hyperventilating and sweating. panic attacks can be super exhausting and it can take a while for your body and head to feel better again. i once had a bad panic attack and even though i didn't feel mentally anxious anymore my body still felt tense and my heart felt like it was going to come out of my chest. after a couple of hours of drawing and deep breathing i felt better. i hope this helps a little bit and i hope you feel better soon</data>

  <data key="d1">hey! i think the best way to figure that out is to talk to her about it. ask her what she wants you to do during an anxiety episode and what the best way to support her is. she's the only one that can tell you what works for her. some people like to be held and reassured and told everything is ok, others like to be left alone. it all depends on the individual. tell her as well that you are always there to support her and if she ever wants to do something, but is feeling anxious about it, that you'll be there for her. it's awesome though that you're reaching out and trying to get a better comprehension of it. i hope things go well for you both.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes, i can relate. i think the feeling you are describing are more on the side of depression. its really hard to break out of but definitely possible. try to take this one step at a time. if its hard to sleep tonight because of the feelings, i would recommend taking nyquil, benadryl or some other sleep aid. when you wake up in the morning, put on an upbeat song and drink a glass of water. remind yourself that its really important to push through and make it to work even if you feel bad. remember that the day will be over before you know it and then you can go home and climb into your bed for comfort. try to not focus on the repercussions if you dont show. if you wake up tomorrow and cant find the strength to make it to work, thats okay. your mental health is more important and even if the worst case scenario happens it will be fixable. everything is fixable one way or another.</data>

  <data key="d1">ive had a couple of those nights. the most important thing is to make sure your body is relaxed and lying down because even though you arent sleeping, that would still be giving your body some rest. what happens with me is the same, i try a bunch of things and none of them work, and the later it gets the worse my anxiety becomes because of when i have to get up. try your best to take that pressure off of your body, and to just focus on being relaxed whether that be awake or asleep. eventually everything will work out, and this will be behind you! good luck!!</data>

  <data key="d1">all you need is either 60 or 90 minutes of sleep. you need to wake up in your light sleep phase so you won't go on and miss whatever you want to wake up to. try noting. every time you have a thought or an emotion you note it simply by saying to yourself this is a thought or that's an emotion then focus on your breathing. every time your mind gets busy repeat and get back to your breath. also try to drink some ginger if you can, settles both anxiety and the stomach. i noticed when i'm anxious i get stomach acidity which prevents sound sleeping, with lots of nightmares.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've experienced this a lot after panic attacks in the past two weeks. everything you're experiencing is normal, i lived the same thing. my reaction time sucks and my coordination is not good. in my worst times, anxiety makes me feel extremely tired and depressed to the point where i can't pay attention enough to watch tv. which in turns triggers my anxiety because i've never felt that way before. anxiety has very intense physical symptoms which are normal and not dangerous. you can check with your doctor to make sure, but everything you've described fits with my own experience. this is the most physically ill i've felt my whole life. get well soon brother. the brain recovers.</data>

  <data key="d1">tips 1. introduce yourself to someone new when you get there, after saying hi to the bday girl, and ask them questions and genuinely try to get to know them. people like to talk about themselves and it will put less pressure on you to carry conversation. also, remember they may be feeling nervous too and you might be helping them to feel included as well. if you dont know a lot of people there, chances are someone else is just like you in this birthday invite crowd. 2. wear something special that you feel good in and listen to fun pump up songs while you get ready. 3. you wont feel as shy or left out of this group of people the next time you are invited to something. all of our close friends were once strangers to us, just something to remember! this isnt a cure all tip list at all, just things that i try to remind myself when im feeling nervous about hanging out in an unfamiliar group.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm a medical student , i have gad , depression and ibs .i finished my fourth year and i did the best of all my prior years through alot of trial and error. i totally understand your feeling .i went through something similar especially on my second year. i had massive panic attacks and suicidal thought, i couldn't look at books without panicking and hyperventilating. i hated that year and my grades suffered but here's what i learned 1 there's no quick fixes, i have gad always did always will and i need to manage around that. 2 therapy helps alot but if you can't afford it it's not the end what i did to get 98 this year 1 routine, routine is my best friend and consistency turns off that panic button. so i woke up all year around the same time. i had a fixed courses schedule and istudied everything i took shortly after i took it . 2 exam times are my worst nightmare so i made sure i studied everything at least once before the exam months 3 quantity over quality finish as much as i can as fast as i can and then do it again and again 4 no social media but keep contact with friends. 5 past exams or exam models so no surprises the key to me was know my triggers and stay away from them and routine</data>

  <data key="d1">absolutely. if you can approach it as something small and inconsequential then i think it can be easier. also don't try and force yourself to spend hours at a time, start with whatever you can focus for even if it's just reading the introduction to a chapter. just come back to it when you can and spend the time you can work on it to the best of your ability. it will feel easier because you will eventually get into a zone of concentration. give yourself time and patience. it's okay if you need to take a lot of breaks. you will feel so proud of any work you accomplish, and you like the subject so there's the internal motivation to learn and that's helpful as well. you are doing so good. keep going!</data>

  <data key="d1">hi! sorry to hear youve been suffering, friend. full time customer service jobs are draining as hell, and when mixed with anxiety can be a living hell. the only advice i can offer is to just remember that its only a job. all you can do is your best while youre at work but after you go home its you time! work life balance is always challenging so try to find some things hobbies you like to do after work so that you have something to look forward to, instead of just work, work work. try to just simplify the situation in your head and remember that as soon as you leave your job at the end of your shift you do not have to even think about work until the next day. try to learn to compartmentalize. sorry if this little bit of advice wasnt helpful but i have a similar situation and all of the above helped me feel a little better or deal with my anxieties about work in a more healthy way. remember to self care as well, and be gentle with yourself. we need you here</data>

  <data key="d1">the biggest thing you learn as you get older is that no matter how bad life gets, it always gets better. the anxiety and depression are going to tell you this is what your life will be like forever. but its a lie. things always get better. you get stronger. thats not something i could have known as a teenager. you will eventually learn to trust this fact, and trust yourself. but you have to give yourself time to find it out for yourself. i would stay at the bakery and focus on getting help. finding a new job can be stressful. i know its tough to stay at a job you dont like, but put your energy into getting into therapy, getting medication if necessary, maybe finding a hobby that you like that brings you joy. maybe a communitybased hobby. surprisingly, i found a lot of joy by joining an a cappella barbershop chorus weird, right?. but once you start feeling better and more stable, then i would recommend you start exploring some new career options. keep fighting for yourself. fight to make your life full of love and happiness. work to surround yourself with people that bring you joy. they wont come to you people are usually too unintentionally oblivious to know what you need. but people are good. friends help fill you up when youre feeling empty. its hard to hear now, but your suffering now is making you into uniquely compassionate and kind human being. stay around so one day when youre feeling better, you can be there for someone else. you are important. you are not your brain. you are not your thoughts. you are much more than that.</data>

  <data key="d1">i wish i had an answer for this. i cant remember the last time i felt at peace. trigger warning medical emergency trauma ive struggled with anxiety my entire adult life but it reached a peak about a year and a half ago. my s.o. underwent a severe medical event. he was diagnosed with endocarditis an infection of the hearts tissue. it had destroyed his aortic valve, and damaged the mitral valve, as well as created holes in the chamber walls of his heart. he was rushed into emergency open heart surgery and the surgeon told us there was only a 5050 chance he would survive. we had 5 minutes alone together to say what we hoped wouldnt be our last goodbyes and then he was taken away for an 8 hour long surgery. thankfully he survived and is still with me today but the trauma of that experience has stayed with me. i try to be positive and focus on how lucky i am that he is still here. but not a day has gone by since his surgery where i havent been inundated with the fear of losing him. i dont want to waste our time together, however long that may be, worrying about him dying. its completely exhausting and i want nothing more than to find a bit of peace in all of it. i havent found a way to do that yet but ill be keeping an eye on this discussion to see other peoples suggestions. op, i hope you can find some peace</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm sorry you have to deal with this situation. it really sucks. trying to get better is hard enough without an unsupportive parent. how old are you? is moving out not an option? have you tried talking to her about this when none of you are upset? try to tell her that you're doing your best to get better, but that it's still hard and you need more rest than some people. would she not be receptive to that? maybe you can ask your therapist to help you navigate this situation, although i imagine you already have.</data>

  <data key="d1">im 20, turning 21 at the end of the year. moving out isnt an option because that requires money, which i currently have none of. i left my last job on thankfully good terms because i was having daily anxiety attacks and couldnt even really work. ive told her that about a thousand times, and she says i dont get to rest if im not working. if i ask her when none of us are upset, its the easiest way to get her angry about it again. its just a really difficult situation at the moment. shes not a bad mother, and i know she means well. shes just too stubborn to consider anything else.</data>

  <data key="d1">flying was my biggest fear when i was suffering from serious anxiety. i get it! it prevented me from going on many trips! eventually when i did fly, what worked for me was getting as many distractions as possible! like i was a kid or something...i brought my laptop, had headphones and my phone with games music, bought the wifi, had a book, basically had anything that could take my mind off of flying. if i got anxious i would watch tv, if that didnt work, i would go on my laptop, etc etc.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've always had a fear of flying...but got more or less desensitized to it when i was in the military as a flew at least a 2 or 3 times a year...kind of had to being stationed on an island...and the flights were of course long. but i've been out for 7 years and have only flown once since then. it's really just take off that scares me and i don't really know why. i think its cause i watched a crash video once as a kid that had a dc10 or something that i guess took off at too steep of an angle...stalled and just nose dived into the ground. so now i'm petrified that'll happen to me even though i saw that video like 20 years or more ago...and those dcs were some old old aircraft without all of the safety features we have now.</data>

  <data key="d1">may be of support to you too. sorry to hear you're struggling so much op, i have health anxiety and it's awful. spent a good few years not believing doctors and thinking i was dying from everything. it's not so bad now. you need to find a way to address the anxiety, look up some self assurance techniques. the thing with health anxiety is it can make us seek so much reassurance from others that it becomes a crutch. learning to self soothe can be difficult, but very helpful. take care of yourself op. i'm not sure what i can advise to help, but know you aren't alone</data>

  <data key="d1">you could try renting a boattaking a ferry, or putting yourself in a similar situation to see how youre going to deal with it before youre in front of coworkers. something i do is take a comfort item, like a safety pin that i can bend between my fingers, or an affirmation band i use my hair ties i can put around my arm and play with when im feeling anxious. i find these items bring me comfort and deescalate my attacks bc i know itll work, and ill always have them on me. scents help as well for me, like lavender or mint, just putting a bit in a cloth i carry or on my wrist.</data>

  <data key="d1">when i have been under a lot of stress and obviously that has caused intense anxiety that is how i felt. i can tell you for sure that when i am really down i call it depressive mood because it is definitely not depression i start feeling intense pain in my muscles and joints. weird, i know. it is best to get some blood work down, maybe talk with you gp and they will give you referrals or do some of those examinations themselves. it is no guarantee but it will give you some peace of mind.</data>

  <data key="d1">a good rule of thumb is the kind of pain and how often it occurs. as time goes you will be able to see a pattern. when i experience certain symptoms that come and go on a regular basis i know they are result of anxiety. but it would still be a good idea to change your gp. they need to be willing to evaluate your physical and mental health when you have concerns. and even if it comes that they don't find anything wrong, and think maybe you have health anxiety being hypochondriac they should send you to a professional for that as well. my ex suddenly started experience intense very very much health anxiety. but he would avoid doctors as the devil. so, sometimes hypochondriacs don't go to doctors all the time but suffer in silence and most of the time family and friends suffer with them. just another perspective i guess.</data>

  <data key="d1">there's a subreddit for zoloft, and it may help to check that out. i found zoloft made my anxiety worse at first, and then the panic attacks went away after a few weeks. i wasn't successful on the medication, but i have heard it work for others. usually it takes about 6 weeks or so to have its full effects. the clonazepam can make you sleepy, but ssris like the zoloft, can do that too. if you're really concerned, i would see about talking to your doctor again. maybe you have to raise or lower the dosage. hope you find something that works for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah, i know it really sucks getting through it right now, but just try to see if it does help before you get off of it. finding the right medication can be a pain, but hopefully this will help. i remember my doctor saying the increased anxiety could stay for a few weeks while my body adjusted, so hopefully this next week for you will be better. i would also suggest, if this helps, write down how your day went and how you felt. it might be good to be able to look by on this a few weeks from now and be able to gauge how you're feeling in comparison, and then you may be able to really understand if this medication is working. it really is just trial and error sometimes, taking more zoloft may make you feel better, but it could also make you feel worse. just try to be as open as you can with your doctor right now and report anything that is concerning. the first couple months can be the worst.</data>

  <data key="d1">aside from recommending therapy and a psychiatrist, i have two pieces of advice. 1. meditation. most people see it as stupid but most people don't do it properly. meditation is the best practice tool for controlling your thoughts. you're sitting there trying to clear your mind. something pops up, and you push it away to again think of nothing. this is literally practicing pushing negative thoughts away, allowing you to choose a positive thought. there are so many distractions, like cell phones, that it's possible to avoid being alone with your thoughts for the majority of the day. of course you'll be out of practice of controlling them. you'll feel like you have no control over your thoughts, which will just make you more worked up and feeling like you're crazy. it's not the negative thought, it's the feeling that you have no control over it. meditation, prayer, guided whatever. all that matters is being able to entertain thoughts and push them away while you channel your focus elsewhere. 2. fantasizing. i've found this is the easiest because it's the most enjoyable. most people do it naturally. before bed if you daydream by fantasizing, you are choosing a pleasant thought which is often good at using it to focus on instead of negative thoughts. most people are alone with their thoughts the most while showering and while in bed. if before bed you imagine yourself in your favorite book, movie, show, or as a rock star or movie star, literally whatever this should be enough to focus on until you drift off. this is way better than trying to use willpower to stop worrying about whatever, because you remain in control which is comfortable. if a bad thought comes, calmly push it aside, freak out for five seconds if you have to, and go back to the daydream.</data>

  <data key="d1">long story short, it varies from person to person. but in most cases its simply uncontrolled over thinking of bad things happening or that could happen. i found mid panic attack physical excercise worked as it helped burn the oxygen. the reason you feel short of breath when you poanic is to encourage your body to pull in oxygen ready for flight or fight, basically a large amount of physical exertion. i found the quickest way to have it pass was a brisk walk or run or dancing to music. the reason you end up feelign all weird and tingly is cos of all teh oxygen in your bloodtsream. it also accounts for the feeling light headed. get your oxygen concetrations down and most of teh relaly uncomfortable stuff wil pass. the need to breath is more difficult but i found holding my breath worked. controlled mind, nothing for too long. just a simple proof that i would continue breathing. thsi all worked for me back when it started off.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's not withdrawal effects it is rebound effects. what goes up must come down. you're temporarily providing your body with an artificial gaba source that has a way higher affinity for the receptors than natural gaba would in our bodies and therefore for the next few days youre low on gaba and also still metabolizing the left over metabolites and those can make you feel gross too ask for diazepam or lorazepam for sleep xanax is too strong for that imo plus tolerance will go sky high</data>

  <data key="d1">i don't think taking xanax that infrequently is related to withdrawal effects. also, alprazolam has a relatively short halflife. if you were experiencing withdrawals, they would likely take place sooner than 35 days.</data>

  <data key="d1">i can relate to this. for me, it's because i need space to sort of retreat if you will. i need to be alone to recharge. i get anxious going away because my house is my safe zone. i also have a lot of social anxiety so being around people with whom i'm not 100 comfortable with is difficult. i guess for the usual fear of judgement and constant over thinking that comes with it. but in regards to what to say to your husband, maybe just try explain that you feel it would be better for you guys to have more space, especially with your 5y.o. if they don't have kids themselves, they may not be used to the typical noises and requirements of a child and you could say you don't want to impose too much. not that i'm saying your kid is super loud or anything, but from experience i too have a partner who cannot understand why i'm uncomfortable and will just tell me to get over it so i think that's your main point there.</data>

  <data key="d1">that's how my anxiety started earlier this year too. then i started having anxiety and panic attacks from being afraid of anxiety and panic attacks. therapy can be a big help but if you are finding it difficult to use the techniques you learn or your anxiety level stays high talk to your doctor about medication. i regret waiting as long as i did to start medication, it has made a big difference in how effective the therapy has been. there is also a good book called the panic attacks workbook. your therapist will likely cover a lot of the stuff in the book but if you like learning on your own it is a good resource.</data>

  <data key="d1">sorry i didn't read your post carefully. stress and anxietyworry, fear are very similar in their physical effects in your body. feelingsense of pain. pain has always been around in our species history as a form of motivationsurvival mechanism. if your leg gets stuck by a thorn, your brain will utilize pain to let you know of danger so that you step out of the thorn. similar concept if you have an essay due tomorrowyour brain will again utilize pain in the form of stress so you write your essay. right now what i suspect is happening is that you're brain is wired to see pain as dangerthe thorn in the thorn analogy and it's trying to use the same mechanism i described above to get you out of that state. others call this fear of fear. but that's only going to result in a cyclemore and more pain, in the panick attack. so what should you do? rewire your brain to see the pain as not dangerous. be willing to experience and accept it. not trying to get rid of it. i know it's tough and it's gonna hurtyou're probably highly sensitive like me but i think that break you out of the cycle. your therapist won't tell you the above but will probably spend the entire session asking you questions and listening. and maybe ask you to name 3 positive traits about yourself. sorry i'm not the biggest advocate of psychotherapy let me know if anything of that was unclear. this is from personal experience</data>

  <data key="d1">if you haven't already, write a list of absolute necessities as in, if you didn't have them you wouldn't be able to live and everything other than them move way to the bottom of the priority list. arrange these necessities in order of priority, and next to each one write a concise plan of action what needs to be done to complete each one. remind yourself of other times in your life where you felt stressed and enveloped by worry, and remind yourself that you survived them, and you're alive today. i like to try and practice stoicism as frequently as i can. which is, only think of things that are under your control, and forget things that are out of your control. a common analogy i see is this you get home to find you are locked out of your house. you don't have your keys, and in that moment you can't think of any way to get in. you stand out the front, venting off and stressing out, but, ultimately, that achieves nothing. in a moment of clearmindedness, you consider calling a locksmith, and eventually you gain access to your house and the whole ordeal is over. house is locked, can't get in stress out, vent off and cause more stress over something that is now out of your control eventually, you consider something you can control, and the ordeal is over. or house is locked, can't get in consider what you can control in the moment ordeal is over that's essentially how you approach things with a stoic mindset. obviously it's much easier said than done, but from my own personal worries, this approach has helped me a ton.</data>

  <data key="d1">for me, i found that it stopped working. it's definitely worth a try, and i've got friends who have been on it for years with little problems. i think my plan was to go down the medicinal route whilst doing cbt, but i didn't quite have the motivation to do the selfcounselling. that, in turn, made me not want to be on medicine. i think it was as much the idea of being on medicine as it was the sertraline not working. like i said, though, i've got some friends who would recommend it any day. please don't be discouraged by my story, and well done for giving it a try</data>

  <data key="d1">i think im having chs too. ive read a lot about this to find a solution for this problem. but there are not many tips from others because what i think, that many dont even know theyve got this issue because they think of hyperventilation only as really heavy and obvious breathing but it can be just slight overbreathing causing that symptoms. you could also search for the buteyko breathing method, its very similar and maybe helps you. i also tried this method with small improvements but its still present as always. maybe we can share some experience? what are your main symptoms and what did you tried else to fix it? also, how do you react to alcohol? is it getting better or even worse? my symptoms are most noticeable in the first 4 hours after waking up and mostly disappear after 1 pm. im always sweating, shaking and i cant think straight. i try to control and lower my breath but it doesnt work weli. i really feel how my brain dont get enough oxygen and im afraid of long term damage because of that. also i got a blown up feeling in my left stomach which makes really loud sounds if breath into it which also helps decreasing the symptoms wish you all the best.</data>

  <data key="d1">i apologize for the really late response! x200b i looked into the buteyko method, and it doesn't seem scientifically sound, but i may want to try it anyway. right now i am trying the dutch method, or the hyperven that i linked, and it has only been about a week but my symptoms definitely improve immediately after the exercise and for the short term. so the holding my breath as long as i can definitely makes me feel a lot better! i think i want to try this for at least 3 4 months, on the site it says something about two months to see improvement for some people. x200b i am having a hard to verify the accuracy of the scientific claims on the hyperven link that i posted. is it really true that you can train your respiratory center to accept higher co2 levels and therefore your respiratory rate automatically decrease? i can't find the science or reliable sources that confirm this is true. x200b my symptoms are different, i have an adhd diagnosis but medicine doesn't really help me, just wakes me up. basically i feel like i have less consciousness 247. like i am not fully in this world. just enough to be functional. my mind is always blank and i have a hard time thinking clearly. i also feel weak a lot, like i just have to put in extra effort to stand longer or something, but i can if i want to. i'll run out of breath due to physical activity that is not proportionate at all, like if i walk up the stairs in my home, i'll sigh for air real quick. but when i play sports etc i breath just fine. i don't feel out of breath more than anyone else, i don't think. i just basically don't feel functional at all and fully engaged in the world. x200b how long did you do the hyperven therapy for? did it relieve your symptoms?</data>

  <data key="d1">no problem! im not sure either if you can retrain your respiratory center with hyperven but it sounds logically to me. i tried it only for 2 weeks and i could improve my holding breath time from 30 up to 70 seconds and it indeed improved my symptoms a tiny bit. but then i got lazy and discontinued practicing , cause as you might know, the symptoms of hyperventilation can make you depressiv and demotivated for doing anything at all..</data>

  <data key="d1">obligatory thats what she said. as a single person with anxiety i understand completely how stressful dates can be. the only thing i can suggest to you is to find someone who understands that you might be feeling overly anxious and is patient with you while you get your bearings. one thing i do to help my anxiety is plan the date somewhere im familiar with or comfortable at. of course im a guy so im usually the one doing the asking, but you can also ask people out on dates and make the location plans. feel free to make suggestions to the guy asking trust me we love it when we dont have to come up with the plan keep on trying, it gets easier with practice. just remember in the back of your mind that dates are really inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. youll either get along well or not. being anxious shouldnt affect your compatibility. just roll with it and think of it more like meeting someone new and getting to know them. thats really all dates are anyway.</data>

  <data key="d1">i was thinking about this guy from high school that i had almost every class with for all 4 years. we were friends and then one day during ap us history he said do you want to go to dinner at my house and meet my parents?. i had met his parents before so i said i met them before remember? and then he said yeah but they want to talk to you. were going to have spaghetti! i was so in love with him and then in that moment i realized that he liked me back. i felt my heart jumping and i but blurted out no. he looked so sad and so i said i mean i don't think my mom will let me. i had rejected people before in the same way but i feel like in that moment i really fucked up. i felt it in that moment and i wanted to just say okay i'll go! but all i kept thinking is oh my god what if you get spaghetti on your face?! what if you eat too fast?! what if you get sauce on your shirt!? what if his parents ask you things and you sound stupid i think that over all if you feel like you fucked up or if you feel like you're about to fuck up by saying no, i think you should force yourself! and even tell him you're anxious. i feel like that makes me feel better when people understand that i'm just anxious. if you feel that way i think you should not let them go without giving them a chance. to this day i feel like i should have seen where that went. the only guy i've ever felt feeling of love for and i never gave him a chance. the only guy who ever respected me and cherished me for reasons other than wanting sex and i turned him down just the same as all the others. i hope you dont make my mistake. force yourself!!! or maybe put yourself in charge of the planning so you can be in your comfort zone. if i could go back i'd say yes or if i was really scared i'd say i'm sorry today i had plans but maybe tomorrow me and you and your parents we can go to the aquarium! i'd love to have a chat with them then at least i'd be in charge of the scenario a little bit. edit spelling and typos</data>

  <data key="d1">i have experienced something like this its the muscle tension. everything is tensing up because your body is preparing to fight or flee or whatever. what helped me is to close my eyes and take deep breaths, and actively say to myself calm and relaxed which does make me feel like a bit of an idiot, but hey, it works and people need to pee!. anyway, doing this helps, as does actively trying to relax tension in my pelvic region and my body in general. fwiw i am female, but i reckon the same rules apply</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you for the suggestion, i saw a cbt therapist for a few sessions. her goal was for me to confront the things which make me anxious in order to overcome them however teaching causes me anxiety and i've frequent panix attacks in the middle of class so i do not think that confronting them is a solution. does cbt offer other solutions rather than the confront your fears approach?</data>

  <data key="d1">yes, the general idea is that we should practice being mindful about how our beliefs, thoughts, emotions, and behavior all influence each other all the time. each person has had a unique set of experiences that teach us about how the world works. we develop beliefs based on our personal life history. those beliefs based on our past experiences shape our predictions about the future. our thoughts are constantly flowing whether we are conscious of them or not, and we feel various emotions because of those thoughts. the combination of our beliefs, thoughts, and emotions are what drives our choice to behave a certain way. our behavior then impacts our experiences which, in turn, affects our belief system and so on... this process goes on forever and ever and not in an orderly fashion! our whole sense of self can easily be reduced to the product of this tangled knot of our thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and experiences until everything is intertwined and you cant tell where the string begins or ends. so any two people can perceive the same experience in very different ways. its like we are all wearing specialized glasses that allow us to view the world in our own unique way. each persons past experiences, and more importantly, the thoughts and emotions about those experiences, create a sort of personalized lens through which we see things. for example, lets say a stranger tells me my dress is ugly. my underlying belief is that people should be nice to one another, or at the very least, people should not be mean to each other. i hold this belief because i was taught as a child that if you dont have something nice to say, you shouldnt say anything at all. also, random strangers dont usually say mean things to me, so i learned that most people seem to be nice. one of my thoughts might be wow, that person was rude and thats not an appropriate thing to say to a stranger. my emotional response would probably be to feel insulted and slightly annoyed. my behavior would be to ignore him and go on about my day. now, lets suppose my big sister tells me my dress is ugly. my underlying beliefs are that she loves me, she wants the best for me, and she has better fashion sense than me. my thoughts might be that maybe the dress isnt as pretty as i thought it was or it must not look as good on me as it did on the hanger. my emotional response might be to feel embarrassed or foolish. my behavior might be to never wear that dress again or to find a way to improve the dress. when it comes to anxiety specifically, most cbt therapists do recommend facing your fears, but gradually and in a specific order. you might be encouraged to list all the things that make you feel anxious and then rank them in order according to the level of discomfort each one makes you feel. then you can face your fears one at a time, the least bothersome fear first, working your way up to the big ones, building confidence as you go. cbt encourages you to hear your thoughts but remember that you dont have to digest each thought. try to let some thoughts just pass through your head without judgement. also, test your hypotheses. since you feel anxious about teaching, try to identify what underlying beliefs you hold about what makes someone a good teacher. try to identify some thoughts you have about teaching that bother you. you might think the students wont pay attention or that you wont be able to articulate yourself clearly. what emotions do each of those thoughts bring? be as specific as possible when naming emotions. saying this activity makes me feel bad is not as helpful as figuring out a more descriptive word, like saying this activity makes me feel invalidated and unappreciated. as we get better at naming our emotions, it becomes easier to understand where those emotions are coming from. so after you work your way up the hierarchy of anxieties you could test your theory that teaching will make you feel a certain negative emotion by teaching a class and then reflecting on the experience afterwards to see if your thoughts or predictions were right or wrong. anxiety is a dirty liar. most often, the things we fear are not as bad as we imagine them to be. sorry this was such a long comment.</data>

  <data key="d1">then it can't be that... the only thing i can think of is you are suffering from a withdrawal symptom but i'm no doctor perhaps you should have tapered more slowly, from 25 to 12 for example have you heard of the ashton protocol ? she's a famous english psychiatrist specialized in weaning from psychotropic drugs i mean legal ones and she wrote a manual to help anyone to tapper safely you can easily find totaly free of any charge on lots of websites. i know from having read it she advocaces when one is suffering from withdrawal to come back to last dose in your case 25 before starting to taper more slowly again</data>

  <data key="d1">this is from my my personal experience 1. finding the source rather then treating the symptoms. so instead of jjst doing stuff to help the symptoms, also getting checked for deficiencies. another thing is to look into the possibility of being intolerant to gluten, which can cause anxiery. 2. cutting out caffine, and if you have it, have it with ltheanine. starbucks matcha tea lattes are great and ginseng can be a good alt to coffee. 3. whenever an anxious thought comes up, instead of thinking about it, learning to pick out if it was simply an anxious thougt, or a normal thought. if it was anxious, imagine it floating by just like a cloud, and then let it go. it sounds hard, but its easy with practice. 4. if youre too anxious to do something, immediately do it. like if you start getting anxious about something, immediately do it, and stop thinking about it. what was most beneficial for me was going to a chinese herbalist and having them diagnose and treat some of the underlying causes, rather than giving me antidepressants and putting a bandaid on the issue. i kid you not, with giving up gluten, and taking the herbs, my anxiety went away in under a month, almost completely. to see if youre intolerant to gluten, take a month where you cut out gluten completely and see how you feel. after a month reintroduce it and if bad symptoms come back, youre intolerant. now obviously there are situations where anxiety will come up, thats only natural, but its down at least 70 from these things. it seems most people dont give these holistic treatments enough of a chance and dont ever think their anxiety could be based on something deeper down, but really it could be. so to recap, besiess getting tested to find out the underlying cause,</data>

  <data key="d1">i used to suffer from extreme, relentless panic attacks constantly, and with the stuff ive done i havent had one in over a month. other herbs that have helped treat the underlying cause is vitamin d3, b12, omega 3, and calm magnesium. the cure i found for my panic attacks, as awful as it sounds, is ignoring them. ik it sounds impossible, but giving in to them was what was causing me to get stuck in a negative loop. ignoring them eventually made a huge difference. so look into diet, herbs, deficiencies and mainly the underlying cause. it worked for me, so i assume it could help others</data>

  <data key="d1">i dont know how much schoolwork you have because i'm not you and i didnt go to your school, but i had a study hall in highschool and i usually could finish half my homework there. also if you have free time at the end of class or lunch try doing homework then. using your free time at school to do homework really saves you hours of homework at home. so what i'm saying is, just try to find free time when you're at school. i was never a perfect student by any means, but doing this gave me more time after school to unwind.</data>

  <data key="d1">when i was in high school, i got very close to one of my teachers...and without her, i would not have made it. she knew that my anxiety and mental health issues made schoolwork a real struggle for me it wasn't that i was not smart enough, i was just easily overwhelmed. she gave me a safe place to go sit and be away from other students that wasn't a bathroom stall. she didn't make me talk to her about anything that was wrong, just let me sit in the back of her classroom. if i was strugglingfrustrated with an assignment...she would talk it through with me or even go reach out to the teacher for that class and ask for an explanation of the assignment. it got to the point where she knew the signs of my anxiety so well she could just look at me in class and know something was wrong, and tell me i could go take a walk around the halls if i needed to. so i'd suggest finding a teacher or administrator maybe a counselor i went to a small school that didn't have those.. that you can connect with or share these feelings with.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi, i'm sorry to hear you're struggling with that. you're still very young, so medication is not the best choice, but in some cases it's necessery to get better sooner. also therapy takes time and hard work. don't give up, keep on fighting and it will get better.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes, sometimes you have to wait until you find a therapist who is the right fit. i've seen multiple and i can truthfully say only one has stood out thus far. x200b may i also commend you on taking initiative to reach out and look for help? that shows a lot of wisdom and resourceful on your part at still a very young age. x200b i'm no expert, but what you are describing seems to be a sort of panic attack. have you managed to find other people whether online or in person who have similar challenges? finding people who relate to you goes a long way in making you feel more relatable and less isolated.</data>

  <data key="d1">do you have a psychiatrist? a psychiatrist can prescribe you medication. depending on how severe it is, they might give you medication. coming from another 13 year old with severe anxiety and depression, therapy is a good route to start with. it's going to take a while to find the right fit, but you'll find it. and last thing bring up meds with your therapist, see if heshe agrees that it'll help.</data>

  <data key="d1">you gotta overcome the worry and don't focus too much on how you're feeling. focus on what you want to do and only what you are capable of doing. you want your grades but that's not in your control. so don't focus on that. you've already done your part. you can't change the results now. you also want sleep. well that is something you can control. watch a movie or show you somewhat enjoy to fall asleep to. drink a beer if that helps you relax but don't go crazy. zone out to some music. pop a melatonin. go for a run and wear yourself out. just do something to achieve your goal. on the plus side, achieving goals feels really damn good. you got this!</data>

  <data key="d1">haven't found a cure. the only thing that works for me is valium or xanax and medication to get rid of any inflammations in my body caused by stress and anxiety. this globusissue is often a mental issue as well. knowing you wont choke for real, can help you calm down. it depends on how afraid you are of it. i'm terrified, since choking or not being able to breathe is one of my worst fears ever. seeing someone choke on something, makes me panic for real, it's like a phobia. so these issues triggers my fear and anxiety, which makes it worse. while for you, knowing it's just in your head, you will clam down. so my tip is, if that's the case, that knowing the facts around it will calm you down and the symptoms will go away on its own, then you have your solution. then you just need to distract yourself, meditaterelated exercises and just calm down physically and mentally. if that doesn't work, then meds is the way to go. for me, meds is my only option but i can't take it every time it happens or everyday, due to risk of addiction.</data>

  <data key="d1">i guess the only thing is mediation or distraction, try to calm down your body and muscles. since the tightening of the muscles makes it way worse, at least in my case. the more i focus on it, the worse it gets. i try to drink a lot when my throat acts up. since if i can pass water, i can breathe. that's my logic of it and it helps to calm it down a bit. so the only true cure, is to fix what's causing the anxiety, the underlying issue. which isn't a quick fix, not for me anyway.</data>

  <data key="d1">the only thing besides addiction to be weary of is that it can make dissociation worse. which in my opinion is the worst symptom of anxiety. so at this point i usually choose to not take it and just ignore my panic attacks it is possible just takes practice not feeding into it and that usually works better and has reduced my amount of panic attacks</data>

  <data key="d1">benzo withdrawal is one of the worst withdrawals out there so i strongly advise not taking them daily for more than two weeks. please speak to your doctor about this and if they tell you to take them daily for more than two weeks seek a second opinion. benzos are an amazing tool when taken as needed but they're not recommended for daily use. i'm an emt and speaking from my personal experience and the one of other redditors here both benzo users and medical professionals. they're the only commonly used drugs apart from alcohol whose withdrawals can be deadly. i don't want to scare you, i just want to prevent you from going down a dark path because your doctor failed to inform you of the dangers of benzodiazepines which still happens way too often. all the best to you!</data>

  <data key="d1">i have periods like these and theyre hell you feel like you need to tell yourself to relax but you just cant. ive had trouble breathing, sleeping, with tachycardia as well. you just need to experiment with different things that can help you relax and get in a better head space. maybe a nice bubble bath with a nice bath bomb, candles and all can help you. maybe a nice cup of tea. im not big on pseudoscience but one time i was so damn desperate i would sniff lavender oil. the thing that would oddly help me relax was holding a heating pad. its gonna be ok op, anxiety sucks so much, its hell, but lets kick its ass together. hugs</data>

  <data key="d1">i don't know if this will help you much except for during a panic attack, but i use a kind of vagal manoeuvre which kind of resets my heart rate and diverts my attention when an attack occurs. it's often enough to stop me mentally cycling back into another attack, and gets me to a state where i'm not panicking just anxious. i get the ones where you think you can't get enough air and heart is racing with palpitations, they really suck. one i do is shove my head under very cold running water, so it hits the back of my head and neck. the shock of the cold overrides the panic and interrupts my ervous system in a way that causes my heart to reset from racing to normal, not having the racing heart palpitations helps deescalate my anxiety a lot. another is if it is cold enough outside in my back yard i strip off and go out to try get shocked by the cold enough to rip my focus off the panic, if that's not enough i'll lean my back against cold metal bare skinned for extra cold shock. i have a diagnosed anxiety depression disorder, but only started the panic attacks in recent years and you have my total empathy as they are extremely unpleasant.</data>

  <data key="d1">its really bad at first, everyone with a panic disorder had that same first few weeks. its absolutlely miserable. if you can, i'd suggest getting psychological help as soon as possible. it is extremely successful in stopping or reducing this sort of thing, especially if you start early. remember though it is a panic attack. that's all. you are not in any danger, no matter how scary it may be. oh, and sometimes chewable antacids can help a lot.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have had many, many clothingrelated anxiety attacks. for me its always that i dont feel comfortable wearing anything and i need to leave the house in something. and if i say to hell with it and put on something basic, ill look in the mirror and just break down because all i can see is awkwardness and discomfort. i think i might have some dysphoria related to my anxiety. anyways, i find it helps me a lot to shop online. make sure youre ok with their return policy in case you dont like what you end up getting. i look for advice in and theres also if you just need to get inspiration for what works in more diverse sizing. theres an awesome clothing company called universal standard that will show you what any given item looks like on a person of all different sizes. its awesome! just know youre not alone, and have hope that you will find something to wear that makes you feel confidant and it will be life changing.</data>

  <data key="d1">does anyone else dae have a similar experience with..... i used to have an app on my phone where you followed a dot as it went around a circle. it also had words slowly fade in and out there would say to breathe in, hold, breathe out, wait, etc. i think it used to be fast calm, i cant seem to find it on the store. there looks to be a few out there that are similar. ill throw in my headphones and listen to an anti anxiety loop on youtube. 5 4 3 2 1 coping worked pretty well for me when i was in the middle of an episode. some days it still gets the best of me and i just breakdown and curl into a ball. i know that it will be over with, the sensation is temporary and that ill be ok. it still sucks fighting so hard to keep it from turning into a full blown attack. luckily, theyre farther and fewer between as years pass and i get better with my coping mechanisms that i learn. pay attention to your posture. one thing i noticed was that i would tense up and raise my shoulders up towards my ears. almost like youre cold scrunching yourself up to stay warm. drop your shoulders, breathe slowly, loosen up a little. youll be ok. remember, it happens to lots of people. internet hi five, stranger!</data>

  <data key="d1">there's always a reason even if not obvious. i stop and ask myself my body, my inner child, depends. i say what are you trying to tell me with these symptoms? what are you communicating to me?. then i sit back and try not to think of an answer. i try to have a neutral mind and just let thoughts pass through my mind. i don't fight the thoughts or run away with them, just let them float by like clouds. meditation or being present is not about having a blank mind or forcing thoughts away. it's just about observing your thoughts without getting stuck in them or going off on a tangentconversation with them. sometimes the answer was that i was feeling hurt by something that happened 5 or 10 years ago, or more. sometimes it was that i deep down felt angry at someone. sometimes it was too many commitments or pressure. sonetimes that i felt really scared of something, or have a very bad view of myself. it can be anything but it's not at the forefront of your mind so you think you're just anxious for no reason. but there are always subconscious things contributing to that. if you only fight it, and think of it as a random glitch in your system that you need to ignore or distract from, then your subconscious may fight harder to get your attention, and you will think why does my anxiety feel worse? ask yourself with compassion, why do i feel this fear? it can be really helpful to view your inner self as when you were a child, like you're asking your child self what's wrong. not angrily asking your adult self what's wrong and demanding an answer. more like how you would ask a child who was feeling very upset... what's making you feel this way? the brain is always doing things in the background including processing memories</data>

  <data key="d1">the source of my anxiety was first wanting to be seen as smart, then the smartestthen when i finally was seen as that, it was huge pressure on me to keep that up. and as i got older meaning age ten to twelve and i began to grow and become my own person, it was hard to come to terms with that because i had a reputation. parents were constantly telling mine that i was such a good child, so smart, so quiet, so wellbehavedbut thats not who i wanted to be anymore. it was stressful to try to always be the perfect child and keep this persona going that i was simultaneously trying to grow out of. in a way, im still trying to grow out of that childhood need to be perfect and have straight as and be the smartest and best at everything.</data>

  <data key="d1">thats actually exactly what ive been working on with my therapistat first i was horrified at the idea, but ive slowly been easing into it. and, to be honest, at first it really just heightened my anxiety, but now i feel as though i can finally relax sometimes because im not trying to do everything perfectly on the first try. the first step, really, was recognizing that being comfortable with not being perfect is going to be a long journey in which i am going to make mistakes and i am not going to be succeeding with flying colours right off the bat. however, i still havent gotten to that point yet and wont for awhile and i feel like the best thing i will be able to get out of it is being able to love myself. which seems like a bit of a stretch from trying not to try to be perfect, but once i can accept that i will never be perfect and that is ok, i will finally be able to see myself as someone worthy of love, because i dont have to be perfect to be worthy of that. im hoping that that revelation will take even more anxiety off of my shoulders, and soon after ill be able to live like someone my age should. whoa that was long, sorry</data>

  <data key="d1">this will happen. anxiety can come and go. the best approach is to keep your coping skills tuned. that doesn't mean to always be on the look out for anxiety. rather, just make sure you're always practicing good self care so that when it does return, you're more easily able to ride it out. i'm sorry that you have to go through this. it sucks hardcore. but you will get through it. keep strong and don't lose hope. edit grammar.</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you so much. i agree, self care is so important. i know that meditation works for me sometimes but when anxiety is peaking, i dont even have the mood to start meditating. im not sure how to take care of myself when anxiety peaks like this because everytime the hangover it gives is different</data>

  <data key="d1">have you spoken to your doctor? they could refer you to a therapist. if you want something more personal ask your doctor or therapist about support groups and maybe you can make some friends who can relate. your friends will never betray you over your anxiety. unless you are constantly texting and calling in all hours of the night i'm sure they are always more than willing to comfort you</data>

  <data key="d1">bro youre chilling trust me, and talking ab it is always the best solution, i was just like u in middle school but now im in high scjool after a therapist and my anxiety is so low now , ive told my friends ab it and everything, i talk ab it a lot and they understand me. they dont judge they aint do nothing , theyre super supportive ab me and like im so comfortable w them, like ill even tell them when im gonna get a panic attack or whatever, if theyre not supportive or understanding then u need to surround urself with good friends</data>

  <data key="d1">i had this too, and medications kind of did nothing. what worked for me was grounding myself and taking my mind off of it. it's a form of meditation but it really works, and i hope it works for you. sit down on a chair, close your eyes if it will help you. you are going to move your awareness, or concentration around your body. start with your toes. the feeling of your feet in socks, in shoes, on the ground. bring it up to your ankle, your legs, how your pants are on them, the fabric. then your hips, your midsection etc. until you end at the top of your head. go back down your body if you want to need to. this isnt a permanent solution, but it might help the urges until you can get professional help to help you get better.</data>

  <data key="d1">if it keeps being an issue, definitely bring it up with your doctor. that being said, i've experienced similar symptoms due to hyperventilationoverbreathing caused by anxiety. symptoms include dizziness and being lightheaded. an easy way to fix it is to practice some healthy breathing techniques, such as 24 abdominal breathing. long term fix will mean targeting the root causes of your anxiety. edit oh and since you mentioned iron deficiency, that could contribute. overall make sure you've eaten enough since being lightheaded can also be caused by low blood sugar.</data>

  <data key="d1">obviously calling your mother names is not acceptable, so maybe a different therapist is actually needed. however, i generally see no reason to seek secondary opinion from a doctor so being that you've been to multiple doctors who i would guess didn't brush everything off, but evaluated your health based on your age, family history, description of incidents, and physical tests and came to the conclusion that you are fine. considering you know that anxiety is an issue for you then it's probably a time to accept that irrational thoughts are common in your head and start taking a proactive approach in dealing with that.</data>

  <data key="d1">i understand. i have days i'm convinced i have some kind of illness, and will compulsively check myself for signs or symptoms. some days i check my temperature 20 times in a row. i've been in therapy for about 3 months and have learned this is a common symptom ? of anxiety and ocd. my therapist and i have come up with a few ways to curb the thoughts, not sure if it will help you but it might be worth a try. 1. we made a list of any symptoms anxiety can manifest itself as so that i can remind myself of all the ways anxiety makes me feel. i usually compare them to what i feel and the symptoms of whatever illness i think i have and find that i'm only feeling anxiety although i'm pretty sure she didn't expect me to use it for that reason p. 2. remind myself that unless a medical professional tells me that i have something medically wrong with me, it's just my anxiety. they went through the necessary schooling and training so i have to trust them. 3. remind myself that my if my friends and family are not concerned about me then i am okay. they would never intentionally let anything harm me and would get me medical assistance if they thought i needed it. 4. remind myself that i have anxiety and ocd. they make me feel that the worst is happening, or will happen i will always have them, so i better get comfortable with being uncomfortable. 5. how many times have i had thought i had a serious illness? how many times was that thought process true? and if you're having a what if thought process then you don't have whatever you're convinced you have. you or your body would know if something was seriously wrong and needed emergency care. then circle back to 3 sorry for the 10pg essay i just wrote you. you're not alone, and so many people deal with the same thing. hopefully you're able to find some peace soon.</data>

  <data key="d1">the easing comes when you can view what you feel as the consequence of prolonged stress and not the illnesses you mistake it for. the same alarm system in your body that would activate if something were actually happening to you, is unfortunately activated without any cause tricking you into believing that something must be wrong with you. you get this tension and your brains begins to dig for possible reasons for this alarm system beeing activated menegitis, cancer, amoebas, autoimmune diseases ect. and if you give it validation it just keeps on looping.</data>

  <data key="d1">how were your experiences with cbt? what kind of excercises did you do? cbt is a term used to lable a very wide range of therapy forms, so different excercises might get you slightly varying results. over the course of 6 years i did a wide range of excercises to overcome my fears and depression. some i found to be very helpful, others not so much and some i implemented into my life as a regular routine. i learned that it hugely depends on each individuals visualizations and their details as for how well they react to different excercises. so exploring the possibilities in this field might prove helpful to you. been posting some excercises on here during the last few days btw. if you're interested i'll gladly post them here again. hopefully you will get better soon.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. i'm 38 and lived with it most of my life, constantly increasing 'til the end of 2014 when i burned out, lost my job... totally destroyed me. here i am, on disability, still trying to scrape up what's left of me. i have a handful of other interrelated mental health issues that i'm still trying to deal with and i've been on 25 different meds for not counting different dosages or combinations. one thing made a massive difference ketamine therapy. oh, i still have acute anxiety and panic attacks from time to time, but that looming shadow monster of unrelenting constant anxiety is totally gone. it's been almost exactly a year since i went through it and it seems to have stuck pretty well. in february 2018, nature published two really interesting papers connecting some types of depression and anxiety to a sort of malfunction or maladaptation of the lateral habenula and how ketamine can basically reboot it. from wikipedia neurons in the lateral habenula are rewardnegative as they are activated by stimuli associated with unpleasant events, the absence of the reward or the presence of punishment especially when this is unpredictable. criminally oversimplifying here, but constant stressanxietytrauma gets your lateral habenula's switch stuck on the we're gonna die mode, ketamine comes in and unsticks the switch... usually... depending on your own wiring and chemistry. i should also mention that, thanks to cbt, i can generally tell if that feeling is creeping in, but i don't feel like i'm right up against the wall any more and i have room to fight back. so i recommend poking around and doing some research. as always, it's complicated and what helps one person may or may not help someone else. ketamine isn't a magic cure, but it can be an extremely powerful tool in the right circumstance.</data>

  <data key="d1">thanks for your reply. ketamine? really? your story seems similar to mine. also, now a year, on disabilty. furtunatly my employer was insured properly so i have no financial problems. but i am not the type that does nothing. in fact i am always driven to push myself further, higher, better. okay, maybe also one of the issues, but i do not think this is just some personal aspects like perfectionism. it is what you say. so it seems. my brain is stuck in survival mode. and is literally interpreting everything as dangerous. resetting the switch sounds rational. i sometimes considered electro shock therapy. just to reboot my computer. but if it can with ketamine... i had a friend that used it in front of me last year. because of bad experiences with mushrooms i did not use it. but maybe i should. will look it up. did you take it recreatinally, or in supervision of a doctor? because i can get some of it easily. and what dose for example. but every idea beside the list i mentioned is welcome too.</data>

  <data key="d1">thanks for your support. i did some running, power lifting dumbells and the last two months boxingkickboking but it is 4560 minutes of high intensity training. like fitness with a little bit technique. cardio does not really help, but i think it cannot hurt either. especially when you are 40 and are fighting to not gain weight. what exercise do you recommenduse that helps? oh. did some yoga too. it let you focus on your body for example, but had no effect.</data>

  <data key="d1">a stopped a lot of bad habits and alcohol is the last on the list. last couple of years i had long periods of sobriety. i want to stop it. because of the damage it does. want my baby to have a father for many years. fact is that in moments of sobriety my system has not a single moment of relief. always on. that burns my energy and simply i cannot deal with that. the symptoms drain too much energy. so alcohol, for now, is my only relief. i know it is not recommend with anxiety. a good hangover results in severe anxiety for example. want to use benzo instead, but that is the beginning of the end. if i find a way, medication or just therapytips, i can stop with alcohol. but i feel you, it is bad. but now not an option. unfortunatly. would give a finger for a cure.</data>

  <data key="d1">my ketamine therapy was done at a clinic set up specifically for that purpose. it was a course of six sessions roughly a week apart. each session consisted of two shoulder injections half an hour apart three on the last one. i started off at 40mg and they ramped up steadily to i think 120mg. they monitored my blood pressure and pulse the whole time. i had a couple of blood pressure spikes which they gave me clonidine for they keep it on hand. i sat in a quiet, dark room with a big window during the treatments. they also had big beanbag chairs, pillows, and blankets anything to help make you comfortable. my wife sat with me the whole time. it reliably took about two minutes for the injections to kick in, and about 20 seconds later my consciousness was smeared across the entirety of the universe. apparently, my brain trips hard with ketamine. it wasn't scary or anything. the best way i can put it is that it was uncomfortable but not unpleasant, if that makes sense. unfortunately, i'm one of those few people that get really bad motion sickness and a heck of a hangover after. after each session, i'd go home and try my best to just sleep it off. it took anywhere from 12 to 18 hours to not feel wobbly any more. that said, i'd still absolutely go through the therapy again. it was without a doubt worth the 1k and postsession discomfort for how much good it did for me.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've been doing cycling one day paired with walking meditations the other day where i'd use hiking paths in the woods to walk while listening to guided meditations, sometimes pausing, sitting down and just taking in the scenery. additionally i did a lot of visualization excercises, especially in the evenings before i went to bed. had my blood tested for amino acid balance and adapted my diet accordingly. i felt that the visualization excercises did a lot for me. especially in case of my anxiety. with depression it took 3 years until i got to where i am today. one of the excercises concerning anxiety i can definitely recommend is the theatreexcercise. it's usually done 1 on 1 in therapy but can be used in private as well. if you want to give it a try... imagine someone made a movie about your life and your fears, that you are about to watch at a theatre that's been prepared solely for you. you grab something to eat and a drink it's free!. what did you get? nachos? popcorn? coke? water? you sit down at a seat that's to your liking. is it near the screen, the middle or farther back? after you've made yourself comfortable the movie is just about to start. you hear the projector starting. you see the classic movie countdown 5,4,3,2,1... the movie starts with that mgm lion intro. it then plays up to the moment right before you'd usually feel fear when suddenly the movie starts playing backwards really fast, like someone hit the rewind button, making the movie run back to the very start. you see the numbers 1,2,3,4,5 when suddenly a yellow rubber duck leisurely crosses the screen quacking. did that duck wear any underwear? if so how did it look like? start again from the beginning and repeat reading that text like 56 times in a row and 23 times a day. how does this excercise work? well... all we ever perceive in our daily lives is time moving forward. it's like the ultimate rule. life doesn't go back in time. so to our subconscious seeing our reality rewind that fast is something abnormal. it's immediately trying to give meaning to the incoming data and by immediately focusing on something ridiculous like a yellow rubber duck wearing underwear or not the scene that once used to hold the meaning of dangerous or threatening resulting in fear as feedback, suddenly gets connected to the meaning of strange, funny and somewhat nonsensical, thus triggering the corresponding emotional feedback creating new neural pathways, so our subconscious mind gains a new option of behavior. at least that's the theory. i hope it works for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know how your technique works. it is, if done right, very strong. did not mention it because i forgot about it, but had similar techniques in the past. neuro linguistic programming. also reprograms neural pathways. helped me ten years ago with fear of flying. the only real phobia i have. also had emdr last year. also neutralises bad memories. helpfull with other things in my life, but no correlation with my symptoms. maybe i am wrong, but i do not think memories or situations cause my anxiety. i really have no idea what triggers it or keeps it active. i think perhaps brain damage blunt trauma, drugs, the hardware seems to malfunction. like i have ptsd but no recurring memories. so i tried some kind your advice. good for specific phobias, not this always draining hell i am going through. but thank you anyway. i will probably use it</data>

  <data key="d1">if there's actually physical brain damage nlp techniques, other visualization techniques or hypnosis clearly reach their limits. if not i believe these approaches to mental health to be the pinnacle of today's available methods, best paired with a helpful diet and a proper workout. if you can't identify the triggers to anxiety it's likely to be generlised behavior, which is very tough to rewire. have you followed the work of dr. joe dispenza? might be worth a read. whishing you all the best and happy holidays.</data>

  <data key="d1">to add to the other comments, one exercise that i've found helps when you have an anxiety attack pain in your chest, accelerated heartbeat, sweating, weak knees, sometimes as if you just got scared or something is to look around the room you are in and find three things or however many you want that you can smell, touch, taste, hear etc., all the while paying attention to your breathing. breathe calmly and somewhat deeply. this has helped me calm down really quick many times. i usually don't do exercises for stuff like this because none of them work for me, but this one is surprisingly effective</data>

  <data key="d1">i tend to have those pains due to the tension i put on my pelvis and hips while doing trapeze, or ya know cramps. not quite a solution but maybe to ease some tension put a heading pad or some pressure to the area to help relieve it. then as this may be anxiety driven it will be good now and again to just lay down and start doing sensory things in other places. like going through and touching your fingers to your palms one at a time, stretch your toes, tense and release the muscles in your calfs and so on. hopefully then it will distract a bit from the discomfort.</data>

  <data key="d1">my two cents if you want to go to japan, then consider trying to fight through the anxiety. you may have a lot of fun if you can cross that hurdle. if you really don't want to go ignoring anxiety, then tell them you're not going to go. no one can force you to, especially some school club.</data>

  <data key="d1">no worries. this is exactly why i didn't go to france back in high school. glad i didn't we basically just watched musicals for a week. it was pretty sweet anyway, if you're not going by yourself, you could use your group as a crutch. stay with the group, socialize, and it may make the trip manageable. the world is a lot less scary when you've got friends with you.</data>

  <data key="d1">don't panic. it's probably just your anxiety making you think you're dying i'm assuming because of what sub you're in you suffer from anxiety. it's happened to me in the past and i overreacted. i'm sure your doc knows what he's talking about. just go for a check up when you get home if you can't get yourself to calm down, but there's a 99.9999 chance it's exactly what your doc said.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've hit a similar hurdle, feeling constantly ill all the time, especially with depression and anxiety, it creates a perfect loop of symptoms that each make the other stronger. psychologist is worth it. list all of your symptoms. list of of the medications, find the links between them. for example with me, i've got gerd, sleep apnea, gastritis and anxiety disorder, they're all related and feed on each other. 1. learning stress management taught me what was going on in my body, doctors didn't teach me that. 2. finding exercises specific to each symptom helped me reduce their impact. 3. lifestyle changes, it's the part that saddened me but it had to be done, knowing i had to work up a sweat to manage anxiety, lose weight to manage apnea, take magnesium because the side effects of my gerd meds and anxiety depleted my reserves. i know i'm talking about my own list of issues, but this systematic and tactical approach helped reduce my panic about physical symptoms, helped me regain a little sanity, even when i thought i couldn't take it anymore. i am still fighting and i hope you can too!</data>

  <data key="d1">i was off for almost 10 months around 9 years ago, sleep schedule definitely gets screwed up. i ended up cleaning and organizing my entire house and quickly ran out of things to do besides watch tv, movies, and video games. there was a small gym in my apartment that i started using in the morning before most people were up. i hated working out, but it gave me something healthy to do. id call my mom or a friend in the morning while they were commuting to work. doing that kind of forced me to get up early and in turn, go to sleep at a decent hour. otc melatonin helped at night to help wind down. same with sleepy time tea.</data>

  <data key="d1">my partner went through something really similar when we started living together, he had grown up on a farm and never had indoor animals before, so it was a big adjustment period. honestly, part of it is just learning to accept that things are always going to get hairy and dirty, but i totally understand how that is very difficult for you. but there is a lot you could do in preventative maintenance that might really help make your job easier. one suggestion ill say first, is one i havent tried but have heard good things about, get automatic selfcleaning litter boxes. you would still have to empty it, but you wouldnt have to be doing it 36 times a day. on to the suggestions that did work for us realistically, having the dog stay outside most of the time is going to make your house dirtier than if she stayed indoors most of the time and only went out for exercise and bathroom time. with a bloodhound, the drool and hound smell come with the territory, theres no way around it. what you can do, start keeping a drool rag around her neck! i keep a bandana on my great dane all the time to catch drool and quickly wipe her jowls off when she starts, so it doesnt end up flung on my walls. you can also get something called a snood to hold her ears in during meals and when she gets water, keeps her ears clean and prevent her splattering with them. there is a laundry additive from natures miracle that i add to all of my loads of pet bedding, it works fantastic for really taking out dog smell, which makes the bedding last longer between washes. its on chewy, take a look. part 2, deshedding baths monthly. two great deshedding baths are by furminator and chi for dogs. its a shampoo and conditioner, and you let both soak on the dog for 510 minutes each before rinsing, this loosens up the coat great and the when theyre dry, you can take them outside and go to town on the brushing with a rubber curry comb. might take 30 minutes to really stop getting hair off the hound dog, but then you will be set. just give her a quick brush down as needed, depending on how much she sheds, every day to 3 times a week. they have a cat friendly version as well! its the same process, let it soak, let dry completely, then just regular brushing will keep it down. it takes a couple months of consistent deshedding baths, but eventually the coat adjusts and the fur will be under control! a high velocity blow drier is a great investment as well for keeping hair off your floors, but it can take some training to get animals adjusted to it, its loud, but takes your drying time down to 20minutes and will blow a ton of loose coat out before brushing. finish with a shed control spray before your brush out, and youll be golden. you could also find a local groomer who does cats and get the long haired cats shaved, kind of a last resort, but it will make it easier to spray them with shed control and use a gentle rubber curry on the coat. it doesnt stop shedding, but it makes the hairs smaller and less noticeable. and with cats, the hair grows back, unlike shaving double coated dogs. regular brushing stimulates the skin and hair and makes for a healthier coat, which means less shedding. also, add some supplements for coat health to the food! a tablespoon or two of coconut oil in the dogs food is great for the skin and coat, and the healthier the hair, the less shedding youll have. for cats, you might try salmon or a good fish oil dropper. id also make sure they have a high quality food, poor diet causes shedding and hair loss. stopping the problem at the source is a lot more efficient than just cleaning up the side effects. for the bowls, what material are they made of? stainless steel and marble are fantastic, easy to clean, and dont hold germs and bacteria like plastic. plastic bowls can cause acne and yeast issues with dogs, because the material holds bacteria in the microabrasions it gets from regular cleaning and use. part 3 was my partner made one room of the house an animalfree zone. the bedroom door is always kept closed, and the pets arent allowed inside. then he had a place he could go and shut the door, not have hair on his clothes, and do whatever he needed to without the pets bothering him. as long as the bedroom is nice and clean, the rest of the house isnt as big of a deal. overall, work smarter not harder! get a chore chart so all of the cleaning is equally divided and no one gets overwhelmed! try to work on limiting yourself to cleaning and vacuuming in the evening, make it a routine, then you clean up the mess from the day, but it doesnt get dirty again before you go to bed.</data>

  <data key="d1">thanks for your incredibly detailed response! i really appreciate it! i went out today and got a better brush for both the cats and the dog and all parties seemed to enjoy the attention i got wads and wads off the big fluffy cat. i totally agree that stopping the shed at the source is the best plan of action. bloodhounds are not meant to be washed very frequently as they have such sensitive skin, and my gf has always been wary of that. however, i might try to take her to a proper dog groomer every once in a while because i trust their knowledge more than mine. i think keeping her indoors more often will help, what you said makes a lot of sense. our back yard is a bit of a dust bowl because we are in a very hot city and its hard to keep any plants alive. all the bowls are stainless steel or ceramic, so they are okay. we feed them raw pet meat, grainfree biccies and the cats get fresh fish as well, i think their diet is pretty good. one of them is arthritisprone so needs fish, one is intolerant to grain, one eats too fast and throws it up, and the dog is at risk of bloat, so all four of them have very specific feeding situations . that adds to the stress, but it's not something we can compromise on. i'm super keen to try the pet washing stuff for the dogs bedding, but the bandanna isn't really an option, as her favourite toy in the world is her drool rag. she has so many rules in the house that we let her chew on her toysbones and her rag, because she loves fabric for some reason, she would go bananas if one was around her neck. i think i might invest in more towels maybe so i can rotate them anytime i'm feeling gross because the few we have get dirtied so often. we can't really do a selfcleaning litter tray as the problem is the way our house is laid out the smell goes straight into our main living room and gfs office, that's the reason we clean it so often. the litter is kind of the least of my problems because it can never be completely clean so my brain doesn't worry about attempting to make it clean? i think it's just the nonstop dealing with the animals throughout the day. we do have a bit of a system where my gf feedscleans litte with the pets in the morning and i do it in the evening, so i think forcing myself to not clean throughout the day and leave it all for that one period will be really helpful, thank you again, thanks for all your suggestions. i think focusing on the source is the best option, and on bad days just retreating to my personal space. p.s. our dog loves great danes, they're one of the only dogs bigger than her</data>

  <data key="d1">of course! im glad it was helpful info for you! i was a professional groomer for a few years lol, and once a month can be a bit much for some dogs, but the furminator deshedding i recommended is hypoallergenic and gentle on the skin and with that moisturizing conditioner soak, its normally nice and gentle. youll be able to tell if its too much for her skin if she starts to get dandruff or gets a bit itchy, then you could switch to every other month or seasonal baths.</data>

  <data key="d1">discord chat in the right sidebar is a useful place online. no idea about meetups. peer support groups are a great idea in general, but you need maybe 13rd of the group to be positive and recovered to some extent, or maybe have a proper therapist, otherwise the whole group can pull each other down. successful anxiety survivors and their stories are hard irrefutable evidence of the reasonability of hope. having a few of these in every group is bound to make the others improve their outlook and be convinced of the possibility of recovery.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think it depends where the okiness comes from. i was ok 3 months ago. thats when i got my first panic attack and the anxiety that comes with it. turns out i was and still am a good person in a storm. and i had a lot of storms during my life parents got divorced when i was little, father died when i was 23, 3 years later mother got cancer and 2 years ago 7 member of my close family died from various diseases. i was there for everybody. i mean hospitals, taking care of them, cooking, cleaning, you name it. at the end of 2019 everything chilled. mom is in remission and so is grandma. my so and i finally got to move in toghether, we adopted a dog. and the panic attacks started. it seems i do not know how to face live my life. my own life. without any drama. without me having to take care of anybody. i guess what i am trying to say is that we all have some coping mechanism that work and that sometimes break. everybody has issues, we just deal with them differently. some have anger issues, alcohol problems, anxity etc. hang in there, get yourself the support you need and things will get better.</data>

  <data key="d1">these things take time, but i promise it gets better. i know exactly what its like to be so anxious you dont want to go outside. my trigger used to be mirrors. i hated myself so much, that seeing myself in the mirror ruined my day. i became afraid to go to any place that i might accidentally see myself. back in high school i used to have to have a pep talk before school saying ok, you just have to talk to one person today and then you have succeeded. half the time i didnt succeed and i would be left feeling empty and useless. i have grown tremendously in the last few years by being proactive, and forcing myself into situations that might have made me uncomfortable. this helped me to grow, and realise that nobody cares. everyone is to worried about their own lives to worry about yours. i also did little things like wear good clothes, wear cologne, shave etc, and the combination of all these things slowly made my anxiety better. i think the biggest realisation that helped me was fact that the vast majority of people are to caught up with their own worries and stresses to care about yours. if youre constantly worrying about how others view you, i guarantee that most others are doing the same. youre not alone, and nobody is judging you.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have borderline personality along with anxiety. i have to control and contain my emotions and reactions constantly. it is exhausting. i can't imagine what it's like not to feel like this. i think the closest i've ever gotten is when i was high edibles. it felt like the weight of the world lifted off my shoulders, as clich as that sounds. unfortunately that's not a state of mind i can maintain and it triggers depersonalization episodes afterwards.</data>

  <data key="d1">see the things is, just because they are not always worried about you, doesnt mean they dont care. im not constantly thinking about my family and friends, but if they recached out to me, id be there in a heartbeat. if one of them got injured i would do everything to help. as for standing out, this is gonna sound so clich, but just be yourself. my dad use to tell me this quote, and for the longest time i thought he made it up, turns out its from oscar wilde i think. the quote is be yourself, because everybody else is already taken. it really put things into perspective for me. dont follow others, but be influenced by them. do whatever you like, as long as you dont hurt other people on purpose. the people who matter will stay and will be there for you. worrying about people who judge you is useless, it adds nothing to your life. honestly, i find it kind of sad that there are people who waste there precious, limited time on this earth, judging and putting people down. what a waste of energy. its impossible that everybody hates you. i know people that a lot of my friends dislike, but whom with i get along great. do the things you want to do, and fuck the people who judge. a lot of the time they judge because they wish they had the courage to try that thing. you gotta have patience, but you also have to try. face your demons every once in a while. do that thing that makes you scared. that first time will feel like hell, but once you do it, the reward is better than drugs. im getting better at it, and that lump in my stomach and throat is still there, but its smaller, and more manageable. its taken years for me to be happy with the progress, and love myself. the world is quite literally your playground.</data>

  <data key="d1">this sounds like a really nice relationship honestly, i know you're anxious about it and how you're handling it, but i think you sound just fine! i think your plan for phonetextsdinner on the weekend sounds great, and from what you said about her behavior towards you in the past, i expect that she will be amenable to it. if for whatever reason it feels like too much for her, hopefully she can tell you that in a respectful manner, and you can take the feedback without getting upset or defensive. relationships take communication, so please talk to her about your hopes, your concerns, and your feelings for her. be aware that after the death of her father, she may not be herself for a while. she may be very emotional, or she may not. after a big loss like that, people can be very up and down, potentially unpredictable for a while. not everyone, for sure, but some, and i just wanted you to be prepared if that's what happens. be patient. you sound like a thoughtful partner, and i hope for the best for you both!</data>

  <data key="d1">from personal experience, derealization will go away once the anxiety starts to chill. dissociative disorders on the other hand usually form after a repetitive traumatic event, and if anxiety is causing that experience, their is a chance that it may lead to it, so you should really seek help if you are starting to feel this way. and nah, you aint stuck like this, all the symptoms usually go away once the core issues are resolved.</data>

  <data key="d1">my experience is that its quite effective for depression, but not anxiety. while it doesnt make the psychological symptoms of anxiety worse, it does tend to be stimulating in general and makes some people feel jittery. this jitteriness does fade with time however. it helps me get up and go and gets the mental gears turning, along with just generally brightening my personality. it works well with ssris, counteracting the lethargy and apathy.</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel i might irritate my so with my anxiety, but he's so understanding and it really helps. i think he knows i can't help what's happening but he also knows i'm trying not to let it get to me. i've also been suffering from an unknown food intolerance so trying to work out what that could be and he's been putting up with me every time i get a dodgy tummy! that causes my anxiety to get worse because it usually happens when we're out then i get anxious and worried and just want to be home. he's always so patient with me and i'd be the same if it was the other way round. i think it helps if the other person can relate even slightly. luckily, me and my so have always been able to talk about literally anything and everything. and when i'm anxious, it really helps me to be able to talk to someone.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have a younger cousin who would agressively tell me how much i would enjoy his playlist. he played songs that i had already heard, such as rap songs from snoop dog or similar. the songs were okay, but his aggresive demeanor was akward to be around because he was expecting me to orgasm or something. in contrast, when i was about eseventeen years old, i had a distant cousin from oregon come to california for vacation. he was old enough to drive and we spent a lot of time driving around la for sight seeing. the entire time, he was playing a cd, that he had burned that also contained rap music. he was singing along, dancing in the car, and telling me how much he enjoyed this music. driving through the cool breeze while listening to these rap songs was a great summer experience. he was so into the music that it was obvious that he didn't fundamentally care how i felt or thought about the songs, either way, it was enjoyable. what i'm trying to say is that anytime i feel obligated to do something, i'll feel a lot less inclined to enjoy it. if i'm just listening to a song that someone recommended, and they're just staring at me, it will be awkward.</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you so much for your support! it does mean a lot to have some people understand a bit of what i'm going through. it doesn't seem like such a big issue because it genuinely doesn't bother me every single day like a lot of people have had to deal with their issues being like that. it makes me feel really guilty because i know there are people in this world who would kill and painfully wish to have just a quarter of what i have. i have been looking into some meditation and some stressrelief tricks to hopefully make myself feel better. i will look into some selfhelp books but i'm always nervous about renting books. i'm very scatterbrained and can't afford to replace anything. i might have to suck that up tho because i'm so broke rn... but applied to a job so, hopefully, i get that. and i do own a pet! sorta two, but it's complicated his name is koda and he is literally the best little pup i know. he doesn't like to cuddle very much but he does like sitting near me at times and it helps to have that companionship. i'm hoping to get an apartment to rent for college next year so maybe i might be able to get a little guy or have my doggo move in with me since my sister graduates next year and the poor guy will be spending 1617 hours alone every day if she moves out.</data>

  <data key="d1">when i started on 10mg of prozac which is half the lowest therapeutic dose the first two weeks were pretty bad moodwise i'm not gonna lie. i was really irritable and it felt like my skin was crawling. i had my dad stay with me that helped a lot because he could help me calm down and distract me. but after two weeks when the medication was done loading it was amazing! my anxiety was gone, my depression was gone, i could do everything without worrying about it. you have to give it time, the suicidal thoughts that they talk about are an extremely rare side effect mainly seen in teens which is why it has the 'black box' label as an adult that side effect is even more rare. if you have people you feel comfortable talking to left them know what is going on because that can be a massive help.</data>

  <data key="d1">your anxiety and ocd are a part of who you are so it's a package deal of sorts. if he's unable to handle that, it may be time to have a conversation about the sustainability of the relationship. the fact that you communicate with him about it is a sign of strength in my opinion. i bottle everything up horrible yes i know but because i'm afraid if i open up to someone they'll leave or judge me for having anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">congrats! it took me 10 years myself, came from home iraq never the same again. didnt see any hardcore combat, a few things here and there, mortarsrockets. but i just never came home with the right state of mind after spending 12 months of oh i could die today before going on convoys. 10 years of fake smiles, 10 years of crowd anxiety, 10 years of loud unexpected only noises, sending me into straight panic. 10 years of wondering why everyone was always so happy and why i couldnt be like them instead of trying so hard to fake it, 10 years of chronic pain from the rigors of just 12 months of full body armor and helmet, just a combination of everything. 10 years. the relief of finally talking about it, finally being diagnosed with ptsd, although not as bad as many, its there, and generalized anxiety disorder w adjustment syndrome. i had no idea i was living with it. so i know exactly how you feel with finally speaking up. it was the hardest, but i think best thing ive ever done to take the next step. prescribed gabapentin 400mg 3x daily, things have felt better since.</data>

  <data key="d1">i would play animal crossing when i wanted to relax you can make the pace as slow as you want and just interact with things at your leisure. harvest moonstardew valley are good too, which are farming games, but there is a time limit as time passes ingame. it's still very fun and relaxing, and not very intrusive. last game are any kirby games. you can't go wrong with those.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know what you mean. as for the wii it has a great variety of games like, animal crossing city folk, super mario galaxy 1 and 2 really recommend this one and zelda skyward sword. all 3 are really relaxing games with a very relaxing soundtrack. zelda can get a bit storyline heavy though so youd have to pay a bit more attention. it would be great if you had the wii u, as you could buy zelda breath of the wild, which is quite possibly one of the most relaxing games ever made! they go quite cheap nowadays so it wouldnt be a terrible investment.</data>

  <data key="d1">oh yes. a little bit too much of an addict, unfortunately. but! video games are wonderful. i totally understand the time limit thing... i would suggest anything that allows you to play and explore at your own pace. i'm not very fond of openworld games as they are a little overwhelming to me, but an explorationoriented game i do enjoy is metroid. any metroid game really... well, maybe not other m. these games have enclosed maps with hallways and rooms. it's a science fiction action game of sorts too, but it mostly emphasizes the atmosphere and exploration. you find items that allow you to access new areas. now, there are usually timed sequences at the beginning and ends of these games, but those are the only onetwo and they are fairly quick. i would recommend any the legend of zelda game. a lot of minimally pressured exploration to be had. some minigames have time elements, but they never play a major role as you are primarily exploring the world and slowly solving puzzles in dungeons. great stories too in my opinion... ...anyway. 3d mario games... the more exploration oriented ones sunshine, 64, odyssey would be good recommends... these ones involved timed challenges a little more heavily than metroid and zelda, so i wouldn't recommend as much but time still isn't the basis for the games. hope this helps.</data>

  <data key="d1">this is a very complicated issue, and it sounds like it is causing you a lot of stress. it is important for you to take care of yourself as well. you can't help your sister if you aren't in a good place yourself. for your sister, the most important thing is to get some kind of treatment. i've linked some information on what treatment for mental health conditions looks like and support for caregivers. this website can also lead you to local resources if you are in the us. if not, i'm sure there are other local resources to help find treatment. as for her not wanting to go, ask her why. is she afraid? does she think it won't work? figure out what the barrier is and then see if you can find a story of someone who overcame that barrier and is in a better place now. figure out if there are goals she has that getting treatment will help her achieve.</data>

  <data key="d1">well i can tell you that hiv is very manageable in the modern day, with resources like prep many peoples status goes undetected or lays dormant. as for stds, some are manageable and some arent. either way just get checked. if youre anxious about seeing your usual gp, find a sexual health clinic. in clinics theyve seen every std and diagnosis out there, tell them the truth. most places will text you the results of your test, often this text is used as proof of your status for your future sexual partner.</data>

  <data key="d1">yep. it is amazing how much one can truly believe that a fixation is the absolute truth. when the brain can't find the real reason for the anxiety, it starts making stuff up. horrific, illogical stories to explain what it feels. too bad that the feelings are a byproduct of a malfunctioning brain and not an actual external cause. but, try to tell that to your brain when it is in the midst of a mental health crisis. anyway... the following is a copy paste from another post our brains are very good at figuring things out. right now your brain has the task of figuring out what is the cause of this feeling of anxiety. first, your brain will go through all the usual list of things that are most likely to be the cause. when it sees that none of the things on the list are the cause of the anxiety, it will go to the list of things that are possible but not probable. if it doesn't find the cause there, your brain will then go to the list of unlikely things. if not there, it will move on to the list of impossible things. as it goes down the list, your brain will compare does the feeling i get when i think of this bad thing equal to the feeling of the anxiety i feel now? if the answer is no, then your brain will decide that this thing is not the cause of the anxiety and will move on to the next thing on the list. it will continue comparing until it finds a match. when the anxiety is caused by a medical problem and not an external cause, it can't find a match on the 'reality list'. then it starts making up fictitious scenarios for what could be the cause for the anxiety. unfortunately, our brains are very good at making up lots of stories that can involk a feeling of anxiety. this time, your brain, while searching for the cause of the anxiety, thought up the idea of being attacked. the thought of being attacked caused you to have a feeling of anxiety. your brain compared that to the feeling it has been trying to identify. your brain found that the feelings are very similar and your brain concluded that it's a match. your brain now thinks that being attacked is the cause of the anxiety. sigh. it's not. your brain can really get things wrong sometimes. this is one of those times. it ran out of real things to compare it to and started making things up. and now you are fixated on being hurt or attacked. sometimes our brains are wrong. don't believe everything your brain thinks.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've resigned myself to the fact that most likely i won't be able to get off it for some time. i've been on medication since i was 14 i'm 23 now and still definitely rely on it quite a bit. however, i also have a number of issues, and not just anxiety. social and general anxiety are very treatable with the proper therapy and there's tons of evidencebased treatments available for them. i'm on a mood stabilizer and antidepressant rather than antianxiety, so if your only diagnoses are anxiety disorders, i would be more optimistic, assuming you are dedicated to therapy, that you may eventually be able to wean off of it. however, i tend to go with if it ain't broke don't fix it, so if it's working for you and there's no medical necessity causing you to need to stop, stick with it. i'd rather have the inconvenience of remembering to take meds daily which trust me, i do not like if it means i can function.</data>

  <data key="d1">personally i always prefer the truth. i think people get in the habit too much of accepting things that they want to be the truth. usually people want the truth to be positive towards them, but generally on this sub its the opposite, people only believe things that are negative towards them. its all about how you do it though, because too many people are contentious just to be contentious, and others are wellmeaning in objecting with someone, but dont consider the ways in how they should object.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think i understand what youre saying and i can see this happening for sure. i wonder why these people dont look for criticism if they know it can better their situations or whatever is being judged? if its on something subjective i tend to look more away from criticism such as fashion or anything to do with self expression. but in other situations that has a pretty concrete right or wrong way of doing smth its standard to accept and actually appreciate criticism. ive thought about this at my jobs because some managers dont tell me if im doing right or wrong or how to improve so i never knew if i was doing the right thing in the correct way. however if someone were to judge my clothes or style or my art i wouldnt really listen to them because there isnt a right or wrong in that sense. in university though especially in writing papers most of us welcome criticism so that we can argue our points better and cover all our basis. if theres anyone that doesnt welcome criticism its usually some deeper issue like they r sensitive to criticism due to past experiences usually some kind of bullying or they are just insecure and havent learned to laugh at themselves. as for people telling other people not to look for criticism that sounds almost like toxic positivity where people say things like you can do this youre independent and strong. u dont need any help or to make urself better to please other people simply just for the sake of saying something that sounds good. but in reality can actually be pretty detrimental to someones situation if they feel like they have to get through smth but dont have anywhere to start since now they cant ask for help or show any weakness. i hope i understood correctly what u were asking and this helped a bit! its 5am here so my writing probably isnt great sorry</data>

  <data key="d1">i always prefer the truth. when i first started hanging out with this guy i met, i would let anxiety get in the way. at first he was okay with it until one day he couldnt take it anymore and walked away saying i come all this way to spend time with you because youre great, but you sit here and ignore me and are always worried about things that have happened weeks ago. when he said that my eyes opened and i snapped out of my pity part over an ex. shortly after i made him my boyfriend and we have been dating for almost 5 years. we really need to hear the truth, even if its tough to hear and process. i think the reason people always give advice that my not be constructive criticism is because they dont want to face reality.</data>

  <data key="d1">first off, congrats! thatis absolutelty incredible. i do agree that we all need to hear the hard truth, its just that, as you surely undertsand, it is how many present said truth. just as it goes with anything, it is always wiser to give advice if you have been through it. personally, when i was going through absolute hell, my judgement was clouded as it generally is in such a state , i took it very personal. again, which is understandable ,i think. i do get when some become frustrated with those going through such difficulties. its also helpful t understand, in a way, what those who are going through it think. tldr we all need to have a better understanding that we all handle life differently, we all make rashdecisions, we all decide things based on some very complex, very personal situations. i believe that one thing,which cannot rationally be argued, is why so many just decide someone is full of shit, or making things up. if we consider those going through depression are irrational, which they generally are, we also must consider, using basic reason, thatperhaps all of us are irrational. human beings are irrational in their nature, so we'd do better to cut one another a bit of slack along the way.</data>

  <data key="d1">therapy might be a good idea. but one thing i've struggled with when it comes to anxiety is the unknown. so the way i deal with it is by slowly making sure i understand what i need to do before i make a decision. how do you eat an elephant? one bite at a time. find ways to make the insurmountable, surmountable. the unmaginable, manigable. make big things into smaller parts of a whole and tackle those smaller things one at a time.</data>

  <data key="d1">youre not dumb, and even if you are weird thats okay. most people are a little weird, thats one of the best things about being a person. i also feel this way a lot, so instead of focusing on my anxieties related to this i try to focus on being accepting of others. if i accept others as they are and try to make them feel welcome they will most likely do the same for me. eventually this will give way to a more natural feeling of unity and membership. you got this, youre awesome!</data>

  <data key="d1">just cut those thoughts off at the pass. literally tell yourself in your thoughts. no, stop it insert your name here and force the thought to stop and then move on. after that, if there really is a problem, it will show it's self. basically, those thoughts are just your anxiety talking, they're not your real thoughts. and that's something you need to understand and come to terms with, you'll probably have to deal with that negative voice for a long time to come. but, it's easy to stop it, just tell yourself no. adamantly refuse such negative thoughts that come from within. if there is a problem in life, you address it and take steps toward solving it. that's the way it's meant to be done. also, everyone is strange, and you can't be dumb if you're introspective, do you think dumb people would know they're dumb? if you're smart enough to know you're dumb, you're at least starting to become wise. knowing you know nothing is the foundation of wisdom. and that's more important than how fast you can do math or solve a puzzle. take it easy my friend, i wish you the best.</data>

  <data key="d1">you could always consult another doctor, the thing is no doctor is ever 100 of anything and theres so many unknowns and caveats to this all. i just realized that while doctors and therapists in general do a great job at helping, they are still human and can overlook some things. that being said, sexuality meant a lot to me as a teenager and it was understandable to deal with these issues while on the psych meds, now that i am off them for a while, i want things to go back to the way they were before four years ago. what i would say is the mind is very powerful as all of us know because of our anxiety and by focusing your worries on this, it could have a knock on affect. that is true, but some people from survivingantidepressants.org showed me stories of people having sexual side effects that lingered up to several years after stopping ssri antidepressants, some cases permanently. it is so weird that at age 16, i was told by sex educators that sexuality can be very important to the wellbeings of many people. now, i don't know if i have to forfeit having good sex, masturbation, and even having kids due to being on these psych meds for years. besides the sexual side effects, how are you feeling generally? try to think of the positives of tapering off and how well you have done, how other things have improved, etc. positivity and mindfulness go a long way in recovery, which is a long process my dear. it's hard. i don't feel sad, angry, or happy but like a robot.</data>

  <data key="d1">the thing is that i really don't know when that would occur. my pcp and ppa both said that it should subside within two to three months after discontinuation. if the problem persists after the three month mark, they recommend that i see a urologist. should i be fine?</data>

  <data key="d1">i love calm, the meditations are great and their sleep stories really help me wind down sleep. i can send you a 30day trial if you want to use it for a bit without paying i already have a lifetime membership so i don't get anything from sharing trials. i agree with daylio for tracking moods associated activitiestimes of day it helped me identify triggers for my anxiety. edited to add, insight timer is a great meditation app that has lots of free meditations. and down dog yoga is a yoga app obviously that's free at the moment due to the virus. yoga helps me as much as meditation.</data>

  <data key="d1">im definitely not a medical professional, but i do have extensive experience with benzodiazepines including lorazepam. as a general rule i would recommend using it no more than three times a week. the less the better. benzos are highly addictive and its excellent news that you can go for prolonged periods without. i know how effective this drug is and how much it eases panic, yet all the anxiety it takes away now, you will have to deal with eventually, ive learned that the hard way. it sounds to me like what youre doing right now is fine, just always remember to respect this and never use more than you feel is necessary.</data>

  <data key="d1">first off, your dad is the one who raised you and was there for you. no matter what this is true. it sounds like he expressed this the day you were born when he claimed you as his. if you want to know who your biological father is, you could explain your worries to your dad and ask him if he would do a blood test with you to alleviate some of your anxiety. i would do this conversation privately with him. your anxiety should be understandable. as a side note, it was extremely insensitive of your mother to make the joke she did but at least it sounds like your dad and mom make light of the situation and aren't worried about you being your dad's kid or not.</data>

  <data key="d1">saw your other post so decided to see what posts of yours didnt get replies. i have had this happen and the fact she told you the next day speaks volumes of her personality and intentions. i dont think it was intentional in the sense to hurt you and i belueve she honestly regrets it. if she is depressed this has probably got her worried shes going to lose you also, so if it were me i would show her how much you love her, console her and be there for her and if shes a good person this will also strengthen your relationship. if you bring it up more it will just make her not tell you if anything else were to happen with other situations even not involved with cheating. good luck and keep your chin up.</data>

  <data key="d1">ive totally been in your shoes my anxiety was especially bad a couple months back and i was waking up stressed and sweaty in the middle of the night too. i started taking a sleep aid and its really helped me get better, consistent, restful sleep. id encourage you to give it a try! now that my anxiety is worse, ive been working on really interrogating it against what i know to be true. when you feel yourself starting to become anxious or spiral, try to remind yourself that its just your bodys response to events that it feels are dangerous and find a way to guide yourself back to safety. that helps me anyway. best of luck</data>

  <data key="d1">im so sorry you feel like this! i feel like that sometimes too honestly, and were about the same age. i suppose i dont have any practical advice to give you, but what i say to myself, and what you might find helpful, is to stop thinking about it as a timeline. maybe youll get married young. maybe youll find love when youre older. maybe theres something else youre supposed to do first. i try not to let people around me influence my decisions or let society dictate my expiration date, ya know? i also try to see everything as an opportunity. when i go to uni ill just be looking for friends, and if something comes of it then thats great! im just going with the flow. but going to uni in itself is a great opportunity to meet people. in high school one is a bit closed off to ones town, but uni you have a whole new world to explore!! i hope this helps you, let me know if u ever need anything else 3</data>

  <data key="d1">there are many symptoms with a panic attack. not everyone has all of them. according to dr. claire weekes if you have had only some of the symptoms mentioned, do not immediately think you must now experience all the others. it is unusual to have all the symptoms. each of us has some parts of his body more sensitive than the rest, and which therefore react more readily to stimulation by adrenalin. if you have not been nauseated, it is because your stomach is strong enough to withstand tension. it should continue to do so. we all know that certain people have a tendency to heave when upset, others to run to the toilet, while others just churn inwardly. few do all three. now if your heart is normal then that's great, but if you're feeling like your heart is slowing down or beating too slowly i'll leave you with her section on that. x200b slowly beating heart it may be that instead of beating too quickly, your heart occasionally beats too slowly for comfort and you have attacks of faintness, when you are sure it is about to stop altogether. in such an attack you may feel paralyzed, unable to move. this is called a vasovagal attack and is brought on by overstimulation of the parasympathetic nerve, the vagus. you will remember that the parasympathetic nerves hold the adrenalinreleasing nerves in check. in these attacks they check too severely and the heart slows to an uncomfortable rate. vasovagal attacks are rarer than palpitations, but they are just as disturbing if you do not understand them. remember, the attack is also the result of too much nervous stimulation. your heart is not diseased. the attack does not harm your heart. as you worry less, sustained tension lessens and the attacks gradually leave you. even after apparent recovery, you may occasionally have one. do not be disconcerted by this. with understanding and acceptance they seem less formidable. actually, your doctor can prescribe tablets to control them, so consult him if necessary. it is well to terminate an attack quickly, as it can be exhausting although not actually harmful. although i teach facing and accepting, i do not advocate stoical forbearance.</data>

  <data key="d1">that sounds incredibly stressful and im sorry youre dealing with this. i know its not helpful to hear but ill say it for my own sake you didnt drink the last one the previous night. there was an extra you didnt see. i know this wont be too helpful for your anxiety though so ill address that too. when this kind of dissociation happens to me, i like to tell myself....so what? its a literal dialogue i have with myself to calm my thoughts before i force myself into distraction mode. if that happened to me this would be my thought process what if i really did drink the last one last night? so what? and then i would focus on distracting myself with a hobby or something. i also have a similar internal dialogue when i start questioning existence in general. when i dissociate and i have a thought such as why bother enjoying this food if im going to die anyway i challenge myself by saying in my head why not. i challenge you to do the same. if you find yourself thinking why bother enjoying this moment if it could be a simulation, shrug your shoulders. and say, why not?. because....why not?</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you. i have always heard the question of why is a very powerful way of dealing with a lot of situations in life. the reassurance you gave me in this first paragraph did help. i think what is really sabotaging me right now is due to this pandemic i lost my job almost 2 weeks ago. i have been at home ever since with my fianc and 6 month old daughter. i find, just like you, when i am not distracted my anxiety and imagination run on over drive. im ashamed to say this but ever since my fianc was about 5 months pregnant i really dont have any friends as they all ditched me. im assuming because of the stereotype that someone with a kid cant be fun anymore. what im getting at is ever since my friends ditched my hobbies kind of went away also because i dont find much joy in say fishing alone. but anyways i wanted to say thank you so much for taking time to reply i am more than grateful.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have no experience of wetness watching a meteorological forecast. saying i could perceive a simulation of being wet is absurd. perception seems to be a conscious intentional state in the brain. of course there could be a hallucination, but if you accept that all of reality is equivalent to a hallucination that seems to entail a cartesian demon, which i find absurd. formal symbol manipulation i.e. syntax, is not sufficient for semantics, and furthermore, syntax is not intrinsic to physics. both syntax and computation are states assigned to it, not inherent. in short, algorithms, computation, and programs are not intrinsic physical features of physics. they are not discovered within physics but assigned to it, it is observerrelative.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi! that's terrible what you had to go throw and i'm glad you're reaching out for help. i'm not trained in this field so i'd recommend a counseling therapist or even a sex therapist to help you better but i'll try providing some tips and hopefully, it'll help. i went through something similar where seeing something would trigger bad memories and it took me a while to train myself to not get triggered. this might be hard but try to associate you masturbating with something else that's more positive. maybe do something that's comfortingfun to you right after or think of someone you like. reward yourself with a treat or a game you like after. when you start getting flashbacks, say no in your mind and try to change your thoughts to something else. it's gonna be hard but it'll hopefully get easier with time.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know how you feel. i suffer from extreme health anxiety and on top of that something called cfsme. it is highly likely that the stomach bloating has stemmed from your recent anxiety. i have had pain and bloating in my stomach for 9 months now. have had a scan and everything but nothing was found as expected. i try to argue with my mind and challenge the idea that i have something horribly wrong with me. for example what is fact? that i suffer from anxiety and this can manifest into physical symptoms or that i have an extreme health problem. dont listen to that devil on your shoulder. you are strong and mindful like you said. you mentioned you dont want to go back on meds so you dont have to. trust your body because it loves you. hope you feel a bit better soon. i wake up everyday with a physical symptom ranging from chest tightness to cramps in stomach etc. youll get through this i know you will. best wishes and hope you are okay. i would talk more but am probably rambling. always open to talk if needed</data>

  <data key="d1">three years ago i lost a family member to cancer. only two months after that, my girlfriend got very sick. in the coming six months were rushed to the hospital twice and twice did i already prepare myself for the doctors telling me they couldnt do anything. those were very close calls. following that i developed anxiety. thought id die of a heart attack, imagine all forms of cancer growing in my body. then, a life saving transplant change our life. we moved to a new city. got new jobs that we like. i made great friends. the point is, there were many points in my life where i was quite sure life was just fucking with me. but, of course, its just different phases. some times are better, some are worse. youre living through one of those shitty ones. good times come after that. im very sorry for you loss. it must be incredibly difficult. you are strong for making it through. if i had ended it all during that year i would have missed many great things. so please keep going. thats real strength.</data>

  <data key="d1">great, thank you for sharing, it can definitely help someone. the 478 breathing technique can also help calm anxiety. it involves breathing in for 4 seconds, holding the breath for 7 seconds, and exhaling for 8 seconds. this can help calm any anxiety that you may be experiencing and can also help you to sleep.</data>

  <data key="d1">i could tell you that, physically, youre most likely fine as far as i know, cancerous tumors dont bleed, and sometimes your lymph nodes feel puffy, but you already knew that deep down. anxiety sucks. i can relate to you, and so can millions of others but you have to remember, youve been here for 29 years, and theres no reason that youre not going to be here for another 29, and many more years to come. if youre looking for things to be off, or wrong, you will indeed find them in fact, we all will but the fact is, 99.9 of the time it is just a result of anxiety and your mind can trick you into seeing things that really arent there. just remember that youre here now, breathing and healthy, and try to focus on the things you can control, like not overthinking. hang in there. also, your bp and hr are good, so dont stress about that!</data>

  <data key="d1">i do appreciate that, i'm just having a mentally weak night. went to brush my teeth before bed, looked in the mirror and my eyes looked slightly yellow. granted my doctor diagnosed me with gilbert syndrome which isn't a concern at all and only has a symptom of sometimes causing a slight jaundice but in my mind i go what if it isn't that and instead my liver has a larger problem? i should be heading off all the what ifs and oh my goodnesses but i'm just having a bad night. luckily i went and brushed my teeth in the dark, odds are good i'm a bit dehydrated due to the diarrhea even though i've been trying to stay hydrated as dehydration makes gilbert syndrome worse, and i'm going to listen to a bit of an audiobook before i head off to bed. things should look up in the morning and here's hoping i don't have any dreams. i wish you a wonderful night.</data>

  <data key="d1">a quick google gave me that piece of information from a healthline article that i pasted below. i will also say that the link leads to the study done in 2015 and what's interesting to note is that in the abstract is says that the cause for these psychogenic fevers is not fully understood. i guess it comes down to our minds having more power than we can easily explain. i will also say if you're having trouble with anxiety, getting professional help is a great start and i would also recommend hope and health for your nerves by dr. claire weekes as an amazing resource to have by your side. fever chronic stress and exposure to emotional events can cause a psychogenic fever. this means the fever is caused by psychological factors instead of a virus or other type of inflammatory cause. in some people, chronic stress causes a persistent lowgrade fever between 99 and 100f 37 to 38c. other people experience a spike in body temperature that can reach as high as 106f 41c when theyre exposed to an emotional event. psychogenic fever can happen to anyone under stress, but it most commonly affects young women.</data>

  <data key="d1">first thing be honest, always. second you don't really need to prepare anything, they usually take the lead. first few talks will be to get to know eachother, find out specifically what you need from them, etc. but if you do want to be prepared, take a look at the different kinds of therapies there are to treat anxiety and see which one might suit you best. cbt and act are two common ones i'm in therapy and it does help me a lot, i am not medicated, as medication is seen as a last resort instead of the first solution where i live. it takes a lot of effort and time, but i am getting better, slowly.</data>

  <data key="d1">first things first i recommend dr. claire weekes' book hope and help for your nerves since i found her approach for handling anxiety to be most helpful. as a broad overview on handling anxiety she's the best. second, consider talking to a therapist. they're there to listen to your problems and may have coping mechanisms that can help you get better. the one i talked to actually recommended me the site below. that link provides workbooks and information pertaining specifically to health anxiety and can help you slowly overcome it. there's no harm in doing them and maybe gaining a new perspective. what ended up helping me though was just slowly exposing myself to exercise again. i told myself that i had a much higher chance of having my heart give out on me by lying in bed all day every day than by being active. your heart is a muscle and it gets stronger the more it's used. so i started small. just 30 minute walks. i did those daily. then on days i felt better i'd add in some other exercises. i'd do some squats or jumping jacks. and you bet as i felt my muscles burn i got scared. so i crawled into bed, did the claire weekes' relaxation technique, got through it, and kept going the next day. slowly but surely my brain will reconfigure itself to working out getting stronger rather than working out heart failure. it will take time but with persistence and a positive attitude your brain will remake that connection.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've tried therapy and it really didn't do much for me. it was when i was younger and my parents could only afford a few sessions. but honestly i don't connect with people that easily due to my anxiety and life experiences. it would take years for me to be able to feel comfortable with a therapist. i did have some limited success with a local hypnotherapist. it helped me sleep better. she teaches the mindroom method. it was 400 for 4 hours, a one time treatment. but it doesn't help in my waking life unfortunately. that's why i thought medication would be worth a try. i help run a business. it's stressful. i have panic attacks and i can't have those of i'm going to take over the business some day. and it's hurting my relationship. i fear talking to him because i fear he will get angry and leave. i'm so afraid all of the time. i just wish i could afford it. the initial visit would be 600 and then 200 for all follow ups. and we all know you don't just get a prescription and carry on your merry way. they want evaluations and the first med may not work. the second or third may not either. it's just too much and i feel so helpless. everyone says to get help. but you can't get help if you can't afford it. even if you want to.</data>

  <data key="d1">im the same, whenever my friends just show up unannounced i just pretend like im not home or whatever to make them go away.. i also need to get in the mindset that im gonna be around people, but 30 min or so after the incident i feel like a asshole. still havent explained this to either of them and i dont really know how, i think one of my best friends kind of get it now because he rarely does it anymore which is nice.</data>

  <data key="d1">i could have written this. i do the same thing. i dont really have any advice but youre not alone! i have a very intrusive, boundarystomping mother in law who likes to help all the time and she will do stuff like that. she will do my laundry, clean our private master bath like look through drawers and cupboards, take the hair out of my hairbrush and clean the kitchen and organize our house. i get full on anxiety attacks if she is at my house and im not there because i fear shes going to stomp all over my boundaries. i know its irrational. i know shes just trying to help but i like privacy and get anxious when other people enter my private spaces without asking.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah i think the feelings of being an asshole are almost as bad as the blind panic in the moment. i dont like the thought of people perceiving me as being standoffish, or my boyfriends family thinking im a bitch. i worry my boyfriend sees me as just weird and unfriendly and he sometimes laughs and says i must have been brought up weird. having someone just say i get why youd feel like that is so nice.</data>

  <data key="d1">those last few months i was very depressed and in a very bad place in my head. lately with all the free time and the bullshit on reddit i started getting way too involved, spending time finding facts left and right. then i stop i thought about what i was doing. reddit is actually not the world, only a fraction of the people in the world uses reddit and most of the ones we hear on reddit are the dumb ones. i did an experiment and started closing reddit as soon as i was getting mad. i did it a few times and never lasted more than ten posts. then i realized all this negativity is just snowballing in my head and getting angrier by the days. reddit has amazing communities. subs like worldnews and stuff like this used to be really interesting but now it just makes me mad so i left the sub. everytime i got mad more than 23 times from a same sub even silly one like i would leave it. i felt bad at first having to leave communities like this but in the end the absence of negativity is way better i feel. maybe try leaving the subs that get you the most mad at first and see how it goes? you can go to from time to time if you want but personally i don't last long anymore on there..</data>

  <data key="d1">its understandable given the crisis the world is in. those of us already struggling with depression issues, this didnt help. but it in no way means its an automatic back down into depression. you survived it before, you can again. best things that are helping me are i delve into what im grateful for every day and i key in on positive distractions like art projects, cooking, talking to family and friends, and being around nature as much as possible, and i laugh! i get around as much humor as i can. these are positives. list them. theyre there. dont let your fear take over in feeling like youll regress backward. believe that you wont and thats the most of it right there. you got this!</data>

  <data key="d1">hi, i am actually in therapy now for my anxiety with a therapist i found using an online service. i used hellodowntime, it's a free service that matches you with a therapist based on a form you fill out where you can describe your problems. i enjoyed the fact that they did the work for me and found a therapist with experience. from what i can tell the range is somewhere between 100160. most therapists offer a sliding scale. it can seem expensive, but for me, it came to a point where my health had to come first so i found a way to make it work. i thought of it as actually investing in myself and it made all the difference. also, it kinda forced me to take it seriously. if i was dishing out money every week, then i was going to make sure i was committed to the therapy work. does your insurance cover therapists. with insurance, it's usually more affordable. if your insurance accepts outofnetwork providers which will give you more provider options, then they will reimburse part of your fees. hope this helps!</data>

  <data key="d1">bravo that you recognize that you are causing your anxiety by your thoughts! most people think that anxiety is caused other people and the situation. to help you trust your perspective, ask yourself what is the thought that is causing this feeling anxiety? then really sit with that feeling to understand that it is all it is... a feeling. ask yourself, what else do i believe about this situation. is this thought more useful than the other?</data>

  <data key="d1">this resonates with me. usually when my anxiety is the highest, i tend to not be rational and lose my sense of judgement as you described. my anxiety is usually highest in the morning or anytime i wake up. it feels intense. it feels like itll never go away no matter what i do. but when it is really high, i tend to need reassurance ocd compulsion. it really sucks.</data>

  <data key="d1">i understand. i'm sorry this has made your anxiety act up again. have you considered talking to someone about your history with your dad? it may help you heal. you may never resolve things with your father, but you may be able to get some of your own power back from him. that said, i would recommend not making too big a deal about the gifts in front of your brother. i fundamentally agree that your father should not try to buy you back, but that is obviously what he feels he should do. accept the gifts and then do whatever you like with them. if you'd rather donate them or give them away, then that would be fine. but there's no sense in making things complicated with your brother. he doesn't understand and your mom is in a tough spot with both of you. he will have to form his own opinion about your father. let him do it on his own. i would either take the gifts and do what you like with them without feeling any obligations towards your father or talk to your mom about your feelings. given that she was the product of your father's abuse, she may understand where you're coming from. it may be worthwhile for her to intervene and talk to your father about the gifts, if she understands why your upset about them.</data>

  <data key="d1">honestly, with anxiety, it takes so much work for me to call someone. so i understand how it is an achievement for you. last friday i was told that i needed to call and schedule an appointment. it took me 7 days to get myself to actually make the call. i was so glad that they actually answered. because who knows how long it would've taken me to make the second call! keep up the good work!</data>

  <data key="d1">when i have an argument with someone, i get anxious about how we're going to move on from it, how mad they are at me, what they're feeling. it's rarely about me, more about what they're thinking. i also would rather talk things out immediately so i can stop being anxious. so when it takes a while to resolve things i have horrible anxiety about it.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know this is easier said than done but try to remind yourself it's not your problem. you left this place because you weren't happy and they weren't meeting your needs. it goes both ways an employee has to be beneficial to the company but the company also has to be beneficial to the employee. be honest when you were working there or anywhere and someone left, how long did it take you adjust to them not being there? in most cases it doesn't take long to adjust to people not being there in a work environment. jobs are going to come and go but your health wont. you dont need to answer your old work calls you have left. take a deep breath and tell yourself it's not your problem. it wont work wonders immediately but over time your mind will come to accept that and move on. you're going to be ok and you have a new job to get excited about and that's more important.</data>

  <data key="d1">sometimes you need to be harsh and look after yourself. i strongly recommend not answering your old works calls. i promise you they are not annoyed at you, some probably are even a little envious you got a new job and new opportunities ahead of you. you might have even motivated them to look for their next opportunity without even realising it. i doubt you were the only unhappy employee at your old job so just breathe. it's not your problem. look at your job as your business. in business if it's not profitable you cut it and move on immediately you dont even hesitate or question it. your job is your business and your old job was not helping you to grow your business.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know exactly how you're feeling. i left a job about 5 years ago now and i lived the same experience. i won't lie, to this day i still think about it sometimes. but i remind myself that 1. it's in the past and should stay there, and 2. it's out of my control and i can't do anything about it. it's hard to stay in the present moment, but once you realize all we have is right now, you feel better. the past is gone, it's over. you're living right here and now. the future hasn't come yet. there is no value added to worrying about what hasn't happened. try to enjoy what down time you have left. we don't know if there will be a tomorrow. i read this great short book that completely changed my life. if you're interested it's called your user's manual by anderson silver, i picked it up on amazon. i can honestly say that i've gone back to it at least half a dozen times. good luck with everything.</data>

  <data key="d1">god i can relate to this. quit my part time job because i felt anxious all the time but it made things worse years down the line. i feel like i'm only just getting back on track try not to blame yourself or be anxious over the unresolved issue, people understand! you were leaving and you left the proper way, and no one has any negative thoughts about that i can guarantee. any negativity you hear from people is towards the issue they're frustrated with not you think about one issue at a time. next time you get a call try not to think of it as this is just the first annoying call of many today instead think i'll deal with this call and then i can relax. split it up in to moments to tackle instead of one long stream of work also deep breathing honestly works for panic attacks. sit on the floor cross legged if you have to and count your breaths slowly.</data>

  <data key="d1">oh, i totally experienced this a couple of years ago. i quit a job that was making me so miserable. afterward, i spiraled into constant anxiety about it for months. my mind created horrendous scenarios that would be my fault and id somehow get in trouble. the most ridiculous, unimaginable situations felt so real to me. it was almost debilitating. luckily i realized i was letting it fester and not talking about it to anyone was keeping me stuck. when i started opening up and talking about it, i was able to recognize my thoughts as just intrusive and annoying, not a representation of reality. i hope the same happens for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">anxiety can put your whole bodymind in a constant state of alert so any sign of confrontation can lead to what you're describing. sometimes i'm so concentrated on just trying to keep myself from not crumbling mentally that i'm exhausted so any little disturbance to the little safe bubble i'm creating in my head can make me incredibly defensive and its not something i consciously do it's an automatic response almost. is he seeking therapy or taking medication?</data>

  <data key="d1">this is hard for me to comment on because i do not know your situation well, but from the perspective of a person with anxiety, relationships can be very difficult. we seek out people that are going to make us feel safe and help us feel more comfortable. so it is extremely difficult when someone we love and seek so much comfort in confronts us even when it is out of love. i personally think it is because we feel like all our insecurities that constantly tug at the back of our mind are actually true. and in that way, we see it as confirmation that we are truly the terrible person we all fear ourselves to be. that being said, none of this is ever grounds for any sort of physical or emotional abuse. if that is what is going on then get out. often when my partner says something that hits those 'back of mind' thoughts i cry. a lot. and the intense emotions make it really difficult to convey what i am trying to say to my partner. i would like to have a mature conversation, but it is being blocked and i don't have control. i would like literally nothing more than to be able to calm down and illustrate my points but i physically cannot. it makes me feel weak and like a child. i hope this helps you understand a little bit more, i am not sure if it will. as for what to do i can only recommend therapy the most either couples or singles. it really has helped me come to terms with a lot of the things that trigger intense emotional reactions. this awareness has made it easier for me to control them. if he ever pushes to far, do not be afraid to make it known, and if you cannot take it, please leave for your sanity. but i truly believe if you both understand and are willing to make steps forward, you can work it out.</data>

  <data key="d1">i still struggle a lot with being defensive, and lacking the facetoface communication with my therapist has made my life a lot harder but i have found that if i am upset about something or i am getting defensive then i find it best to write letters to each other. that way you both have a chance to explain your side of what is going on in a less confrontational way. you can edit your words to make sure that the correct point is being portrayed and i really recommend laying it all out there and saying everything you feel in writing. for me, it is a lot less scary to write a letter than have to face confrontation. let me know if this works for you!</data>

  <data key="d1">you would be surprised how little air we breathe normally. our diaphragms are often pretty constricted because of poor posture and tension. our normal autopilot breathing is really shallow, and its just a bad habit made worse when accounting for all of the moving around and talking we do, which takes up more air efficiency. its something that gets worse with anxiety, while anxiety also makes it worse. one of those stupid cycles. so take that deep breath it helps to activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which calms you. you can also take the opportunity to meditate on your breathing for a short while, and check in with your body. the deeper the exhale, the more tension you let go of.</data>

  <data key="d1">its all in your head. you can eat things youve eaten before without an allergic reaction. you know you can, so dont let your anxious mind convince you otherwise. you know whats logical, and your fears are trying to control you. you can go outside without fainting, you can breathe perfectly fine, you are young and healthy and you have every ability to live your life like anyone else. the adrenaline will come in waves, the key is to let it happen, acknowledge it, and not to fear it. it cannot hurt you. none of your fears can hurt you. you will be okay. you have desires to do these things you wish, listen to them. do what you want, for it will yield calm and happiness when you do these things and none of your fears come true. take it a step at a time. try a food you like that you know will not hurt you because youve had it before. take deep calming breaths, and realize your lungs are fine. you said you have struggles with your throat, im thinking you might have allergies, because i have that same issue. but it cannot hurt you. you will be okay.</data>

  <data key="d1">okay so i have anxiety and it seems very similar to yours!! i would freak out about eating certain foods because i was scared i was gonna have an allergic reaction and die. also, with my anxiety personally, any little thing in my body that seemed wrong or concerning would send my body into a full anxiety attack. like if my breathing seemed off or if i had a little pain in my stomach i would get super anxious which made me feel worse and a lot of times i convinced myself i was dying lol. but guess what? i'm still here. i know it's so hard to feel that way every day. just remember that you control your thoughts, so don't let your thoughts control you. i know it's easier said than done but try to catch yourself in that thought process and change it! when the overwhelming thoughts start coming just completely step out of it for a minute and tell yourself you're not thinking that way. also about your throat, whenever i'm anxious my throat gets tight and dry and sometimes even feels like it's closing. so that could be a possibility for you as well! everything is okay. you're okay. don't stress. deep breaths.</data>

  <data key="d1">i am sorry that you have to go through this. but trust me when i say this, i wish that i started addressing my anxiety earlier. go see your doctor about it and see if he will recommend therapy. it will go better than you think. you will get better. but what sucks is that this kind of stuff doesn't resolve on its own, it only gets worse as time goes by. i was in therapy for the first time in my life today and it was fine. what i was told there is that anxiety doesn't respond to rationalization. i can say to myself thousand times that i will be fine and still think that i am having a heart attack. there is no tip, trick or quick fix, the only thing that works is medication and therapy. and the sooner it is started, the faster it will start working. i left my anxiety untreated for a very long time and it caused a lot of unnecessary suffering. so go see your doctor about it, he will help you and you will get better .</data>

  <data key="d1">my anxiety is similar in some ways to yours. something ive recently discovered is a method of not internalizing bad thoughts like the intrusive thoughts that are irrational. basically, the method is to distance yourself from the thoughts. in the video i watched, the lady explaining described the mind like a train station. you can watch the bad thought come into your head like a train coming into a station, but you do not have to interact with it. you can watch it leave, like a train leaving. this has been helping me for a couple days now. i hope this helps!</data>

  <data key="d1">wouldn't hurt to get checked out since dizziness is such a vague symptom. that being said i often get dizzy from being anxious even if there is nothing causing, i.e. driving. it usually goes away on its own. also i get dizzy if i need to drink water or need a snack sometimes before noticing i'm hungry thirsty. next time it happens try drinking some water and having a saltysweet snack and see if it helps. this works when the dizziness isn't going away.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah this is quite common. obviously we are not meant to walk around in the same state as if a predator was chasing us all day, and that state would include all the mentioned symptoms. in this case there are no predators, no threats, but you're still in the same state that would dictate there were so you focus in on the symptoms this state produces and mistake it for the predator. you're not going crazy, you're not in danger, you are in a state of fear and keeping it alive by beeing afraid of it.</data>

  <data key="d1">hello. i've been experiencing something very similar for over a week but i haven't got any bloodwork done yet cause i'm simply too scared they're going to tell me i'm dying. i've been anxious all my life but never to this level. a little over a week ago i had a very rough week, dehydrated myself and had a small panic attack while rock climbing. once i got lightheaded it never went away and i started to think something was really wrong with me. i know there's so many things that could cause dizzinesslightheadedness and my family is so convinced i'm just depressed and anxious but i can't believe this is just anxiety and i'm really scared of getting bloodwork done, although i know there's no other way of getting it checked. ibuprofen doesn't seem to work and i don't feel like i'm going to pass out but my heart is going really fast and it's so hard to focus my vision and bright lights are almost unbearable. i basically think i'm dying and i just wondered if anyone experience something similar?</data>

  <data key="d1">hi, im so sorry youre dealing with this. it was in fact anxiety. nothing is wrong i promise you. i know its hard to accept that. what helped me was heating pads on the back of my neck at night to reduce tension which helped with dizziness and headaches. also meditation every night. literally 10 minutes is all you need. try to stop the googling and reddit searching as well. i promise it will get better but it will take time so dont give up if you dont notice a change right away. also, i didnt realize how much tension i was holding until i actively made myself release it. every hour or so, actively release muscle tension and see how much youve been holding. soon enough you will stop holding so much</data>

  <data key="d1">i used to be terrified as well and when i started one, i actually only got a few days in until i gave up because i was so afraid of the side effects and have never been on meds before. i spent another trying to naturally heal my panic and anxiety and nothing worked, so i tried again. i was completely fine. the initial side effects were minor and after 2 months you have to be patient, i woke up with a weight lifted off of my shoulders. its taken me a year and a half to work through the anxious thoughts you have to be aware therapy is also needed to heal anxiety. ssris make you feel more normal, but then you have to fix the underlying skewed thoughts at the end of the day, which only you and a professional therapist can do</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel you about being overwhelmed, and worrying you're hurting other people. that's a really hard pill to swallow. sometimes i feel like if i don't say something, i'm letting harm happen, or letting people think i don't care about them. but if i do speak up, so often they seem annoyed or hurt anyway. i try my best but a lot of the time i just feel like i'm not built for this world. when i talk to my counselor or someone else about it they often say basically that it's my brain distorting what's happened focusing on negativesjumping to conclusionsetc. and that these feelings aren't helping me and aren't helping me be good to the people around me. but it all feels so real. as for 2019, well... i remember a lot of memes about how excited people were for 2019 to be over. i don't know how you felt about it then but, as bad as things are now, i think a lot of people are looking back on 2019 with rosecolored glasses.</data>

  <data key="d1">no, it prevents some of the intensity when eaten close to the sugar. it's quite odd because my heart rate can stay elevated for 8h so it's not just the normal digestion and glucose spike. my best guess is that too much sugar being digested at once triggers some exaggerated response. protein makes me relax by itself and slows down the sugar absorbtion so my body reacts less intensely to it.</data>

  <data key="d1">i had something similar but it was pretty much after every meal. i was on zero carb diet at the time so i would have pretty fatty meals. i was also free from nicotine and caffeine at the time. as soon as i ate for the first time in the day, my heart rate would jump and stay around 80100 give or take for the whole day, up until a couple of hours after falling asleep. nowadays i suspect that the symptom was related to gastritis. months after that i went back to drinking huge amounts of caffeine until it culminated with the rest of the gastritis symptoms, like nausea, pain, and in my case panic attacks and continued palpiations and chest tightness. it was only after going on a gastritis diet and medication that i started to heal and my heart rate returned to normal. i'm still healing from it but nowadays i can eat a lot of stuff and my heart rate will be normal 6080 within an hour or so after eating. triggering foods will have my heart rate elevated for a longer period of time. i have to say, during those months when my heart rate would be constantly elevated after eating, i didn't have any other gastritis symptoms, no stomach pain whatsoever and such. this noticeable but not huge increase in heart rate for a prolonged period may have to do with acid reflux or stomach inflammation, or the inflammation of the vagus nerve due to reflux. if it ever becomes a recurringconcerning problem, i recommend getting your stomach checked out.</data>

  <data key="d1">unless something has drastically changed, probably there is nothing to worry about. if they chose to hang out with you before and chose to be supportive aka care about you, why would they suddenly change their mind? i have sometimes in the past thought about what if my friends don't enjoy my company anymore especially if i haven't seen them for a while, but every time i see them again i realize my anxiety has been completely unfounded. but sounds like you have a lot of stress about college too, have you talked to some school counselor or whatever it's called or some therapist about it. maybe it could help?</data>

  <data key="d1">i never used to think that yelling was an anxiety trigger for me, but during the quarantine period here, when i was locked down with three roommates, there was a lot of tension in the air, my roommates were having arguments and yelling at each other a lot. i realized that it was triggering really severe anxiety for me. i dont do well in hostile combative environments. and then yesterday i was yelled at for packing up stuff that i own in the kitchen, because im moving in a week and a half, and today im experiencing very bad anxiety. my heart feels ready to beat out of my chest when im in a common area. i dont really think of myself as thinskinned, but i think yelling and hostility might be triggers for me.</data>

  <data key="d1">absolutely, and even if it's not me that's getting yelled at i'll get anxiety. i only discovered this last summer when i was working at an internship. the two guys in charge it was a small start up would often get into arguments where they would yell at each other. even though they would never get angry at or yell at me, i would enter this mode where i couldn't focus and didn't feel at all like talking. definitely not you being thin skinned, and if anything feeling anxious is probably better than what some people do, which is get angry back, leading to more yelling. also i totally feel you with the getting paranoid and fixating on angry sounding voices in the background.</data>

  <data key="d1">well, i'm a teacher, and i also have anxiety. lifelong. however, i got two major thesis papers out of...discussions with my classmates. so i do believe in them. i tend to do class discussions that have some anxietylowering characterisics giving out plenty of warning before they happen, posting general questions that students can prepare for, time in class to thinkwrite and do small group discussion before we move to a whole class discussion, things like that. however, class discussions can be very productive. they are the place where you can hear what others are thinking and how they responded to ideas and readings, things that make you say, gee, i hadn't thought about that. as a lifelong anxiety sufferer, i can still say this confidently practice helps. while i have always taken steps to mitigate student stress in my own classroom, and have occasionally excused or assigned alternative exercises to students who were overcome with anxiety, there isn't any way one can get around it entirely, either in school or in the workforce. i have coached many a student on how to prepare and practice, even negotiating questions they'd like to be the ones to answer so that they can actually participate. but we can't, and shouldn't, eliminate them from our arsenal of techniques, or continually excuse students from doing things that are hard or uncomfortable this is because the reality is that learning has both content and social components. ultimately, class discussion is too important to leave out. communication with others about complex ideas works it is one of the hallmarks of our species. it is how we got where we are, and it is, i believe, what will save all of us.</data>

  <data key="d1">i find this very hard as well. what really helps me is to note down any commentsquestions i might have when i know a discussion will take place. for example, if somebody is presenting and i don't quite understand something, i write it down. or if i disagree with a specific point on the slide. there is usually some context available beforehand and you can really use the time wisely to prepare your part for the discussion. or if it is supposed to be a spontaneous question, i phrase it in my mind once and then raise a hand and ask it so i don't overthink too much. practice is key!</data>

  <data key="d1">you absolutely have that right. i've thought i had anxiety for a long time, and recently went to a therapist about it for the first time. i expressed the same feeling of 'do i even have anxiety, or do i just get anxious about everything?'. she responded that we know ourselves better than anyone, and being anxious is a pretty clear emotion. if you feel anxious on a regular basis, you struggle with anxiety. you don't need to be diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder to struggle with anxiety, even on and off over periods of time. hope this helps, and i also want to recommend the whole 'seeing a professional' thing, if it's financially possible. i was so worried about the process, that i didn't seek help for years. but in the age of teletherapy, it's never been easier. you don't need to go into an office! i text chat with my therapist and do a video session once a week, and it has really helped.</data>

  <data key="d1">used to bite my nails to the point where my fingers would all have their own heartbeat. i watched this video of a girl on youtube explaining stuff about how to stop biting nails and she said that for a lot of people me included we do it because we are nervous because of something. i was nervous because of school work. im still nervous but i have planned stuff so that i dont have to worry about them being on my kind the whole day. i have counted everyday that i didnt bite my nail and after 21 days of not doing something it isnt a habit anymore. so figure out what makes you do all of the nail biting and lip biting. you dont have to have a reason but thinking about why will help. make a calendar or a small journal or use just the notes app on your phone and write down your progress. even if it feels like you have not really done anything worth writing down. keep that up for 21 days. it might seem time consuming or irritating but it will be worth it. also putting in sometimes taking care of your nails and lips will make you feel a bit bad for ruining them for biting them and such.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi! im not afraid of flying either but something about not being in control and being in an unfamiliar country triggers my anxiety. if you explain it to your doctor im sure heshe can prescribe xanax or something similar to be taken abroad. i had a trip to the caribbean island of st lucia and ended up having panic attacks to the point i couldnt leave my room. a st lucian doctor prescribed me some xanax and i was all set. i ask my doc at home for some before trips now. good luck no shame in taking some pills temporarily to help ya feel better!</data>

  <data key="d1">tell your doctor and they will prescribe a one time benzo. also tell the airline and flightcrew, they are used to it and can try to be extra calm and stuff. lastly you don't need to wear a blindfold, nobody is forcing you to wear one or even sleep for that matter.</data>

  <data key="d1">i literally just called my doctor. i didnt even go in for an appt. ive done this multiple times, as i fly fairly often for work. lots and lots of people have severe anxiety when flying, youre definitely not alone. give your doctor a call, be honest, and see what they say.</data>

  <data key="d1">you're resting heart beat should be 65 to 70 so for it to be that high means you need to work your heart out a little more so it doesn't need to beat as much to get blood to your parts. 120 is a typical panic attack 160 is pretty fast but i wouldn't worry about it i would just try to start moving to get your heart to be strong.</data>

  <data key="d1">this happens to me all the time, especially at night but whenever i focus on breathing really. i think what resolves this for me is to play some game on my phone like geometry dash, because then my mind is free to reset my breathing as my focus is sapped by the game. this is actually why breathing exercises dont work for my anxiety. this also happens to me with my eyes at night by the way, they seem to start hurting when i close my eyes and i have to open my eyes and look around to get them to stop. feels like theyre straining when theyre not. weird.</data>

  <data key="d1">had this. typical anxiety. take it as your brain telling you to stop. when you get detached you will find its because you have been thinking too much and ruminating too much. so your brain will detach in order for you to stop. so try to put your attention to a task and stay away from dr google at all costs. it gets better when you listen to your body and stop putting more stress on your system</data>

  <data key="d1">your psychiatrist should be tapering you off the klonopin. not leaving it to you to figure out. not trying to scare you but withdrawal from klonopin can be dangerous. i would asked her to slowly taper you off. she should know how to do this. she should also no that it's not ok to just abruptly stop it or leave it to her patient to figure it out. edited to add if she is unwilling to do it. i would either go to urgent care or find another psychiatrist. i know neither of those are easy but it's super important to taper slowly.</data>

  <data key="d1">you can't come off klonopin that quickly, it needs ot be tapered a lot slower! your doctor is an idiot. also, do not start the stimulant at this time, your brain is aready in overdrive, that will make it much worse. concerta is a stimulant that speeds everything up, klonipin slows everything down. you may not need the concerta after getting off klonopin and finishing withdrawal. please read this guide from kaiser, it talks about withdrawal staring at page 8 or 9. they suggest people on it more than a few months taper 10 a week, but said some have to go as 10 a month drops. they make klonopin in .125mg tablets.</data>

  <data key="d1">first real deal panic attack is absolutely fucking terrifying. im sorry this has happened to you. my first very serious one was 4 years ago. i have been ok with managing it. right now is incredibly hard for me though. that jolt of energy and the heartbeat just starts beating and breathing feels weird and you actually kind of start saying your goodbyes and how you dont want to die but you think its happening. i understand the pain all to well. i also know fulfilling lives can be lead. first things first stay away from drugs and alcohol. second remember this is mental and physical. mentally its hard to control. but you can do things in the moment. usually something mindless helps ie videogame hot hot bath maybe even a run. sometimes staring at the beast and saying not today works, other times its futile. breathe with the belly not the chest. but be sure to do things that better yourself while your not on high alert. if you are living the way that is healthy and helpful to your well being then the panic wont be as terrible when it comes. i promise if you take these steps things wont be perfect but will help.</data>

  <data key="d1">generally anxiety medication is supposed to make it easier for you to function in your normal worksocial life with significantly decreased symptoms. it's not supposed to make you dazed or spacey, ideally, although some people end up settling for that as a trade off. it's not supposed to make you feel like a zombie or a completely different person. any side effects you might get should settle down within the first two weeks. give them that long and then report back. your pdoc is going to want to monitor you really closely at first to see how it's affecting you, so you should be in good hands there. it might help to keep a little log to record how you feelany side effects you might have. also it's not supposed to make you feel zero anxiety. i've been on meds for years and i finally found a combo that really helps me function, but i'm still anxious. i'm just not breaking down into crying fits, driving myself to the er every week, and doing really harmful and reckless actions like quitting jobs or throwing everything i own away because i'm convinced i'm going to die at any moment. xd</data>

  <data key="d1">heck yea! i firmly believe in celebrating these sorts of victories. and let me tell you, i do a lot of athome workouts and i used to feel selfconscious about anyone seeing me. over time i started embracing that a gicen exercise might looks silly or awkward, or the fact that i'm sweater. so if my partner or inlaws come downstairs while i'm throwing air punches and some sloppy roundhouse kicks, i just ham it up. once i was in a sumo squat and when my husband came down i turned around and full on like... shuffled towards him in the sumo while flinging jabs in his direction. humor helps me a lot. so you might look funny, but you know what, you're doing the work! and that's more than most people can say. you showed up and that's fucking awesome.</data>

  <data key="d1">so proud of you! i recently started running following the c25k program please read about it, they have a great free app too and it has been amazing. it's one of the few sports that you can do absolutely alone. i also hate being observed while working out, and awkward interacting while out of breath and sweaty. i try to find the most isolated but safe and scenic routes. also, the best kind of music to exercise to is electronic. yesterday i was about to give up halfway but a random trance song came up on shuffle and it pumped me with energy to keep going and while i slowed my pace, i managed to finish the run. when i said i'm gonna start running it took me three days to actually get out of the house and on the road. i would be standing there in my new shoes and sports bra, almost ready to go, and suddenly i just couldn't do it. i couldn't move from that spot, couldn't imagine myself walking out that door and intentionally do exercise. i hadn't exercised in years and i was afraid to find out exactly how unfit i was. check out the c25k reddit, there's a man who made 9 attempts to complete week 1 day 1. even if you're looking for a different kind, this guy inspires me so much.</data>

  <data key="d1">i would text him once more after like 4 days. then text him again the week after and if he doesn't respond, something happened or he just doesn't want to talk to you. then text him after 2 more weeks or something if you want to keep going. anyways, if you keep pleading and he gets mad at you for being clingy, my personal opinion is that a good friend wouldn't just ignore a friend in need, especially if you've clarified that you need help. best of luck to you.</data>

  <data key="d1">probably not. my phone makes a constant vibration when it dies, so that may be it. and that's kinda related to your theory, where i'm not connected to anything at that point. i'll try to see what makes me worried by making my phone vibrate some more. it's quite an odd thing, but i bet it's something like that. thanks.</data>

  <data key="d1">congratulations on your first apartment. thats a whole accomplishment. when my husband and me moved out for the first time i was still scared even though i had someone. i think it was because my husband worked nights. one way i coped was having my cats around. they gave me company. another thing was keeping my mind busy with television or decorating. its always best to remind yourself that youre safe within your home. you have the doors locked, you have a way to call for help if you absolutely have too. i think if you have to take your sedating medication, i would just take it. youll sleep and be calm. please dont put your body and mind through stress if you can give yourself self care. i do the same thing.</data>

  <data key="d1">my anxiety especially nowadays, is a mix of full on rage that i try so hard to control, panicanxiety attacks, and uncontrollable overwhelming feelings of like guilt. i do everything to make it better, then its right back. its like a cycle, and im just so tired. ive learned that this is how i will be living. but i do want to live alone, like having my own spaceschedule everything, calms my anxiety down by a lot. anxiety is inescapable honestly, ive learned to work with it. nonetheless its miserable as fuck, because you cant have a good time, you have no control over yourself, and you cant function the way you used to, which in turn creates more anxiety. two things that help out a lot is praying or meditating, and exercise.</data>

  <data key="d1">your whole life? i was only aware of being anxious of driving when i actually started driving initially learning, and then after passing the test. im pretty much over it though. i didnt drive for a while after passing my test. i drove recently though and didnt feel noticeably anxious. i just accepted that i was going to be driving and was glad to be driving again. when you confront your fears, you naturally become less anxious as your confidence increases.</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel so relieved when someone posts something like this, i feel for you. i have had shortness of breath for over a year now. i just cannot take a deep breath, very rarely can. i went to the er countless times because i put myself into such a panic about it, thinking its heart related, lung related, pulmonary related. i had a lung function test, 100 blood work, oxygen levels all 100. i recently had 2 ct scans, with and without dye, 100. had 2 heart scans, 100. i feel hopeless. my doctor wanted me to try anxiety medication to see if it helped any, i've been taking wellbutrin for a month now and nothing. my last hope was seeing a gi doctor. when all of my heart tests came back normal, the doctor recommended seeing gi for silent reflux gerd. because that can cause shortness of breath. i saw the doctor a few days ago and they want to do a sort of test where they sort of stick something into my esophagus and monitor my stomach acid. since you said you have heartburn, i think that is what i'd look into. i know the gerd fb groups and reddit threads are helpful with hearing how everyone else feels. i wish you the best!!</data>

  <data key="d1">ive got this and after a million medical appointments and months and months of research i believe ive got a form of ocd called sensorimotor ocd. ive had every medical test under the sun including mris of my lungs, heart and even my head and no one could find anything wrong with me so started to think it had to be psychological which led me to ocd. i really feel like just in the last week ive really got on top of it and cant tell you how good i feel its not consuming my every though and im not constantly trying to get a deep breath. basically what ive worked on over the past 12 months is just accepting it and not fighting against it you need to take the anxiety out of the thoughtneed to take a deep breath. its really hard and doesnt happen overnight but its definitely helped me a lot. i went back to exercising which id stopped because i felt i couldnt breath even though it was uncomfortable to begin with but everytime i got through a spin class was another message to my brain that there is nothing wrong with me. its about exposing yourself to the feeling of desperately needing a deep breath by sitting with the feeling as long as you can which wasnt long to begin with and letting your brain know there is no need to be anxious. it seems counterintuitive to be thinking oh well thats just how i breath now but it really does work. its definitely anxiety related and its the anxiety that glues the whole vicious cycle together. once you can lower the anxiety over you breathing it all starts to drop away. the thought that youre going to have this forever and its ruining your life and why cant it just be like it was before are all ocd symptoms which just raise your anxiety even further. you need to trust your body that it knows how to breath which it does and you dont need to manually control it. good luck ive had this since january 2019 and its taken me this long to really feel like ive got it under control.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm not a doctor so i ofc recommend getting the usual battery of tests to make sure you don't have something else. that being said, i have recently realised after having undergone countless tests that i very likely have hyperventilation syndrome. it started soon after i had started taking ritalin stimulant for treating adhd in combination with large amounts of caffeine. i've ceased taking ritalin and caffeine but the symptoms persist. i've looked around a bit and i found one site that seems to explain everything. essentially the theory is that there is some part of our brain that controls how frequently we breathe based on the co2 levels in our body. in theory, people with hyperventilation syndrome have brains that have become used to lower levels of co2 in the body and thus breathe more frequently. on the opposite side of things, freedivers have brains that become used to higher levels of co2 in the body and thus breathe less frequently. the supposed solution is thus to essentially train your brain to become used to higher levels of co2 through holding your breath. to save you all the 80 euros that i paid, the exercise is as follows 1 breathe out fully. 2 breath in fully through nose, trying your best to breathe abdominally. 3 start a stopwatch and hold your breath you're allowed to blow out air however you like. 4 after x seconds, stop holding breath when you have reached your limit. 5 wait x seconds. 6 repeat steps 1 5 ten more times. you do this exercise two or three times a day with at least three hour gaps between sessions. sessions should also ideally be before meals or long after meals. after a few months you may be cured. i've found it stops me from hyperventilating for a few hours. i have no idea how well it will work long term. if you're as desperate as i am, give it a go and see how you feel. it seems plausible enough. the sad thing is i've been unable to find any rock solid solutions for fixing hyperventilation syndrome other than fix your anxiety which i don't have so this is the best i've found. edit also if you exercise whilst not being anxious and you don't feel better afterwards then you might not be hyperventilating. exercise also depletes oxygen and raises co2 which should counteract hyperventilation at least temporarily.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have a lot of the same history as you. im 37 now, and a couple years ago i had trouble with shortness of breath. ive had allergies my whole life, but never bad asthma. but apparently allergies can present differently when you reach 3040s. after a misdiagnosis by a general practitioner, a pulmonologist sent me to an allergist. pulmonologist also put me on montelukast fluticasone inhaler, rescue inhaler. the allergist did a full allergy test, which included two appointments where my back was tested for many many allergens. i am allergic to pollen, mold, animal dander, dust. i began receiving allergy shots, and within 6 months my breathing symptoms had improved enough to stop the asthma meds, which can have side effects. one of my biggest asthma triggers has been high emotions. i have adhd and a history of anxiety disorder, so i can get pretty keyed up, and my first bad shortness of breath symptoms appeared around the time of my wedding. now, occasional panic attacks are the most frequent trigger for the asthma. but the allergies are the underlying issue that keeps my airways twitchy. thats how my pulmonologist describes it twitchy airways meaning the small muscles are contracting in response to triggers, and narrowing airways that are already somewhat inflamed. the montelukast reduces the amount of immune cells in the lungs, which are triggered by allergic reaction and can build up, causing inflammation. about 2 weeks ago i had the worst flare up in a while and am takin the the montelukast until it gets better. i also have stopped anything that irritates lungs. im an ex smoker vaper so i know its not always feasible to just quit. but i found patches and gum to help. by the way, im in maryland, so if youre in dc and had these issues recently it could be to do with our weather. i learned recently, when a thunderstorm is moving in air from near the ground is pulled up high into the atmosphere, and pollen particles are broken up into even smaller pieces, which then fall back to the ground and can be breathed into the small airways in the lungs pollen is usually trapped in the mucous membranes before reaching the lungs. so maybe theres something to that. my adhd rambling is kinda taking off so ill wrap it up if you havent yet, i would suggest you see an allergist for a full work up. they can advise you on how to help recover from mold exposure, and rule out other allergic causes. talk to whoever prescribed for the mental health aspects, and if it isnt a psychiatrist maybe consider a referral to one so they can help you work out the risksrewards for montelukast your other medications. dont underestimate the role of stress in breathing issues. even though i have a bunch of allergies, elevated emotions are the biggest trigger for shortness of breath for me. maybe try some breathing exercises. lots of people with asthma get into bad breathing habits. ive noticed my adhd can also make my breathing fluctuate, and i have to focus to regulate it. if this issue continues to affect you a lot, please do follow up to find some answers. i feel so much better since beginning allergy shots. i hope you find the right balance to help. please feel free to ask here or message if you have any followup questions, especially since we have a lot of the same history. edit just saw what you wrote about breathing exercises. when i saw the pulmonologist, i learned that my type of asthma wasnt creating low oxygen levels, but it was causing my lungs to be hyperinflated i kept taking deep breaths but not breathing out enough air. try breathing in slowly through your nose, then out through pursed lips. this helps bring the lungs back to normal. also my first symptoms began after losing about the same amount of weight you mention. glad that the weight loss improved my health, but wonder if the changes in the body makeup and muscles can affect things.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi op, im sorry youre dealing with this. in a cognitive behavioral model, we would consider all of those behaviors rephrasing, rereading, consulting, etc safety behaviors. it is reinforcing the idea that you need to do all these for people to understand your emails. when in reality the person reading the emails probably wouldnt even realize typos etc. the more your able to just hit send and move on the better. in addition, try not to dwell on the email after youve sent it. this is obviously easier said than done, but if you can take gradual steps youre basically doing exposure therapy by yourself. let me know if you have any questions.</data>

  <data key="d1">i guess you have to figure out the root of why you feel that way and take baby steps to address the root cause it might help to find songs that make you feel the most calm and have those playing intentionally during that time... or maybe an interesting audiobook or podcast. maybe some snacks. something calm and pleasurable to ease the stress</data>

  <data key="d1">i need someone to help me understand if its heart palpitations and how to reduce it as its scaring me a bit age21 male 511 151 pounds no underlying health conditions as of yesterday, ive been getting fast heart beats with hard bumps that starts a 4 am in the night and continues onwards until i sleepdidnt sleep till 730 or 8 am. it honestly keeps me up at night as i try my best to not focus on it and eventually i feel a hard beat from my chest which wakes me up and keeps me up. i believe this happened to me before when i use to think i had sleep apnea but the feeling went away in a week and i slept normal again. i tend to eat a snack but didnt do so yesterday. only ate 2 pieces of chocolate cake 210 am or so and then took a pill of vitamin b at 3 am today didnt take one yesterday.heart palpitations happened again around 4 am and kept me up still as im writing this. im trying to sleep and it wont let me which im a little bit scared something will happen to me. i did 3 tests in total with the ekg apps on the phone and it turned out to come as 75 beats per minute resting which i found odd. when i try to sleep, it feels like its more. my questions are is this heart palpitations? what can i do to reduce it? if im in the middle of one, what can i do so it can slowly go away? thank you for reading! i hope to get a response so i can learn more about what i have</data>

  <data key="d1">hi! what youre describing does sound like heart palpitations. palpitations can feel like a jolt or a skipping of a beat. they generally last just a second or so and then your heart beats normally again. normally they are benign and can be related to caffeine intake or anxietystress. i get palpitations, and they sometimes make me feel awful too. i find theyre definitely related to stress for me, and i had more of them when i was pregnant too. what position do you sleep in? side, back stomach? if im having them when sleeping, i try to not lie down on my left side. when you lie on your left side, your heart sort of rests against your left chest, and i find that i kind of feel them more strongly. so ill switch to sleeping on my right side. hope this helps. sorry youre having this issue.</data>

  <data key="d1">its just anxiety. it does nefarious things to you. the fight or flight is working against you causing more palpitations. the best you can do to calm your heart is deep breathing and drink lots of extra water, having anxiety can make your entire system feel funny. inflammation occurs because of the fight or flight. i wouldn't suggest you take any b vitamins especially at night because i think they are stimulants not a doctor btw. always have water at your bedside. and research a meditation app and practice deep breathing. you will be fine. also, keep a notepad close to your bedside too. when the palpitations happen write the emotional response and try to find a link to them. consider having an essential oil diffuser too by your bedside, its super calming.</data>

  <data key="d1">its a day late, but here i am. i've been decorating my bedroom like a proper adult this summer since its the first time in years i've had it to myself. i painted and distressed a couple pieces of furniture, and also painted a faux patina onto a terra cotta flower pot i'd recently painted copper. today my artificial succulents arrived via amazon, so i added them to the flower pot plus one other i got a few weeks ago. i go back to work tomorrow and i don't want to go. i'm tired of the constant 10hour work days. since we had today off, we will likely work saturday so we don't fall behind on production. right now we're making between 16001800 machines per day on both shifts, and management is modifying the area and individual jobs so we make 2000 per day. at that rate, we may never see an end to 60 hour work weeks. i have no life and no friends. i haven't dated or been on a date in legit years, and seeing my little sister have success in dating everywhere she goes just disheartens me and makes me wonder if i'm just undesirable and ugly guys don't even flirt with me. at the same time, i really like being alone and free. in this pandemic, maybe its a good thing, but it's honestly no different than before. right now, i just want a long hug, and i'm not a huggy person. i want closeness with someone. covid has pretty much taken that away from everyone who doesn't have a significant other. i have an appointment with my therapist on wednesday. it's one of the few times i get to have a deep discussion with someone outside my family anymore, so i look forward to my sessions with her. i think instead of the same old covid talk we've had, i might try to bring up my lack of social and dating life.</data>

  <data key="d1">i really feel you, i'm in the same situation too. my therapy sessions are the only time i can talk with someone who understands too. my family members don't get it either, and i've basically given up trying to explain and express my anxiety to them. i also currently have no friends i can talk to anymore either, so that makes it hard. reddit is about all i've got right now. its wonderful that your campus has gotten a therapy office to help people like us, and that it's free! i hope it works well for you! best of luck to you.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's difficult to do but write down how to ask for your money back and just be straightforward. they don't seem to have an issue asking you money for a burger so you could just say hey remember when we drank the other night? can you reimburse me for that or buy me some beer? if that person is decent then they won't have an issue. if they have a problem with it then you know to never do anything for that person again. i have roommates and they are okay people and im just straightforward as possible. if you have issues with roommates you could separate yourself from them like i did when living at home.</data>

  <data key="d1">all i can say really is that please try not to feel guilty. that sounds like an absolutely useless piece of advice, but i'll elaborate a bit. some people find some things harder than others. so things that may seem easy to me might be more difficult for you. and that's okay. everyone finds things hard, and just try to focus on you. again, i know this might sound like useless advice, but try and just focus on how you do things. i think its quite mean of others to get annoyed with you, and they might not know what you're going through. people need to be more supportive please don't let their words make you upset. sorry if this seems like useless advice, but try and focus on doing things your way. remember that some people might not know what you are going through, making their mean comments invalid.</data>

  <data key="d1">i understand. i always struggled with that as well but whats helped me was just getting straight into it and knowing exactly what id be doing because if you overthink or second guess too much then we would back out but trust me when i say no one is staring at us or judging us silently because everyone is just there to workout, not judge or make fun of people. actually, everyone in the gym is locked in their own world just focusing on themselves so dont feel like once you walk in that all eyes will be on you because thats not the case.</data>

  <data key="d1">i totally get it. im really self conscious at the gym and my anxiety kicks in. i have a couple of suggestions that could help. im not sure where you live, but where im at theres an all womens boxing workout gym where they have trainers and classes. looks like your name is kristin and mine is too so i assume youre a girl but if not i apologize. being in classes with all women helped my anxiety a lot! first class was nerve wracking but it got soooo much easier as time went on and the classes kicked my butt. so i suggest doing a google search for something like that in your area! also, when covid happened that place got shut down. but im really into working out so i bought something i can do at home called the mirror. its pricey at first for it, then 40 bucks a month. but that thing is awesome! so many classes and they upload new classes all the time and they are super easy to follow! as much as i love working out im not always very good at it lol. but these classes are easy to follow, fun, and theres a class for everyone! no regrets buying that thing! i hope one of these suggestions helps. anxiety sucks.</data>

  <data key="d1">absolutely yes, it is one of of the things that gets me the most anxious. my father is a person who is always taking very loudly and shouting and sometimes when i hear his voice i start to panic a lot. one time when i heard him shouting at my mom i had a very intense panic attack and cried a lot. loud noises affect me in general, but hearing people shouting and arguing makes me loose control. i suppose that my system gets alarmed because it notices that something is wrong, but having anxiety makes this feeling a lot worse.</data>

  <data key="d1">domestic tensions cuts right to my core. that's a big reason why i am almost always wearing headphones or playing music in my room to insulate me from picking up on the rest of the house. i just can't seem to take conflict and confrontation then drop back to normal right after the way other people can. whether it's my parents when i was younger, or housemates during college. sometimes i call it pathological empathy, my made up term for being too receptive and affected by being around negative emotions.</data>

  <data key="d1">so my take on it is if its used to treat etoh and opiate withdrawal then you can absolutely withdraw from it too. i dropped my travel pill case and ended up losing about 6 pills which is two says for me. so i was two says short and my doc wouldnt give me the refill early . long story short, today was fucking awful. i was in withdrawal land all day. hallucinations, vomiting, shakes...you name it. as soon as i got a pill in my i could literally feel the color come back to my face.</data>

  <data key="d1">my psych lied to me and told me it was not addictive and now i cannot sleep without it and if i got without it for more than 2 days i get extremely ill, i cannot get past 4 days without taking it the withdrawal just gets worse and worse, i am puking having hot flashes my stomach burns. i know you tapered off how long did it take?</data>

  <data key="d1">like two months or so. start by doing 34 of your normal dose. if that doesnt work go up a little. also learning to manage anxiety helps too. you always gotta remind yourself that its not even real anxiety, its just because youre going through a withdrawal of sorts. reminding myself of that always helped me. your psych also probably didnt know any better as doctors are all told that these drugs are not dependence inducing. best of luck dm me if you have any questions</data>

  <data key="d1">here i am a year later, trying to figure out why stopping hydroxyzine is making my entire body itch. basically everything that it treats, even things i dont normally have like allergies, has ramped up 1000 since i stopped taking the pills. my anxiety is way worse than it ever was before i started taking them, i have a little itchy spots all over my body, i wake up every morning and spend 30 minutes blowing my nose. and this is after almost 2 weeks of not taking it. if this drug is not supposed to have withdrawal symptoms, that is simply incorrect. its not true, it is false information.</data>

  <data key="d1">2 years later here im suffering horrible withdrawal from hydroxyzine after 3 days first day was fine. its really scary how much mental health plummeted, the anxiety is really painful, which i didnt have before, i used it to sleep. my doc didnt tell me it would be hard to get off. at some point they need to give informed consent but the pharmaceutical companies probably dont tell them hydroxyzine causes dependency and pretty severe anxiety withdrawal if for me i have to figure out a taper feels almost as bad as valium withdrawal but more anxiety less depression. wish i knew and i would have taken every couple days not nightly</data>

  <data key="d1">im glad i found this thread, because i was starting to think i had something serious going on and am leaning more toward withdrawal even though my doctors are going to think im crazy and tell me its not withdrawals. i had to stop taking hydroxyzine for a week for an allergy test and yall. i have been vomiting non stop for almost three days, have the worst headaches, neck pain, jaw pain, and my anxiety is just through the roof, cant sleep. allergy symptoms are absolutely ridiculous. i do have underlying health conditions lupus and ankylosing spondylitis, so getting sick isnt new to me, but jesus this is rough. idk if i should call the allergist and tell him whats going on and just get an allergy blood test done not as accurate though, or just tough it out for another week.</data>

  <data key="d1">just found this thread as well. i was given hydroxyzine to help sleep during benzo withdrawal. i was taking anywhere from 5075 mg a night for a month. i of course felt like crap but have just been attributing it to the tapering from klonopin just .25 to sleep. then i started getting severe muscle twitches and turns out hydroxyzine can cause muscle twitches so i immediately stopped taking it and i have been feeling like death. that was 5 days ago. nauseas, can't sleep, extreme anxiety. this whole time i was thinking it was the benzo withdrawal but now i am wondering if the hydroxyzine is part of the problem. i am so mad i was given this to try to help benzo withdrawal. once i am off the klonopin, i am never touching another pharmaceutical drug!</data>

  <data key="d1">my gf of 4yrs is in rehab, and they put her on hydroxyzine i've told her the thing she wished for the most and i would only say yes if she fixed herself and got cleaned up off of kratom she drank like 8 hole spoons every 3hrs and it made her super sleepy and just kinda out of it and i've heard that the withdraws from kratom are like heroin so she goes there for 1 month and i only get one 10 minute call from her every week and on the third week i was trying to remain calm but i cried and apologized for every mean thing i've said to her told her she can finally say she's engaged instead of fibbing about it to her friends and i get no reaction no emotion just a 2 word response she reassured me she loves me but with no emotion and she said i miss you hydroxyzine in higher doeses causes mild sedation she's soo sedated right now and i have all these things that i've told her and i'm afraid she won't remember it. and now i have to worry about her coming home and either withdrawing from the hydroxyzine or being a zombie. i'm so torn up right now. i can't eat can't sleep and yall just made it a bit worse, but all i can hope for is that a month isn't enough to cause a bad withdrawal. i've got 15 days until i pick her up and 11 days until i get to go vist her. i've just got to hope that she remembers what i said and it's my fault she got addicted to the kratom that's the kicker and i don't know if she's able to emotionally process how sorry i am. i've got 11 days of feeling like human garbage to get back to. i might return with an update. if not then the program was very beneficial to her. i can't explain how crushing it is to have everything to apologize for and tell it to a person and it goes right through her not even acknowledging it i just have to hope she's layed down in bed tonight eating the huge bags of hard candy i brought her today and it finally clicks for her surely she'll remember. if anyone has any experience going through rehab on hydroxyzine, please please let me know if she will remember or that it just slows the emotions reaction time. i'm soo sorry emma.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey first of all, what do you mean by bad interactions? upsetting? awkward? onesided? if an interaction isnt going the way you want it to go, you always have the opportunity to try to change it. sometimes it wont work, sometimes it will, depending on the person youre interacting with. if you feel there are any awkward moments or lack of enthusiasm from the person youre interacting with, try having an open few questions in your mind to ask to break the ice, andor to gain the interest of the other person. this can be as simple as what are your plans for the rest of the week? this shows the other person that you are keen to hear about them and gives them opportunity to talk about themselves which people love to do! but most of all dont be afraid to be yourself. be confident in you, who you are and what you want to talk about. not everyone will gel with you and thats okay. with the right people, conversation will flow and you wont be made to feel this way</data>

  <data key="d1">hello! i hope this finds you well. i can understand what youre going through. but i do feel that you might be overthinking this. there are a lot of possibilities about what happened. people accidentally press buttons i cant even describe the amount of times, ive unknowing written or unknowingly done things on social media thatve later caused a commotion. it could be a technical error facebook does this a lot of times they probably just block people that unfriend them not a big deal, trust me okay now lets rule out these possibilities and genuinely consider that they blocked you because you unfriended them. i assure you they probably dont even remember when that happened if you ask them in real life. social media genuinely doesnt matter as much as people think it does. lets consider the tiniest possibility that they are holding a grudge against you. i dont think that it should matter because if you unfriended them, they clearly were not that big of a deal to begin with. im sure there are a lot of people that love you, theyll keep loving you regardless of your social media!</data>

  <data key="d1">bit of a late reply, but for me, 2 things worked. i first realized that i get bad dizziness if i take any more than 5mg at a time because i'm quite sensitive to medication. so instead of taking 7.5mg 2x i take 5mg 3x a day because i won't get dizzy from the 5mg dose. perhaps taking 10mg 3x instead of 15mg 2x could work for you? the other thing i tried is set an alarm for 12 hours before i need to wake up, quickly take the dose, and then go back to sleep. not sure if that would work for you, but for me it ensured that i was still asleep, or at least lying down while the dizziness hit. anecdotally, my friend takes 10mg in the morning and 20mg at night, and that seems to work for her. i've not heard of many people doing that kind of split but maybe something to discuss with your doctor if it sounds like something you'd want to consider?</data>

  <data key="d1">when your anxiety or depression get overwhelming, first find a place where you feel safe or comfortable. then work on grounding yourself. you need to find something to pull your brain out of that state, and back into focus. sometimes this can be counting breaths, meditating, the alien trick, or a certain motion that helps calm you down. i have some suggestions if you would like them. after you've grounded yourself some, focus on what the cause of that moment of anxiety. each trigger affects people differently, and while you can't always avoid the trigger, you can have a backup plan. finding something that helps you ground yourself for each trigger of your anxiety and fears can help. if you're having suicidal thoughts, or are considering hurting yourself, please reach out to family members, or a crisissuicide hotline. they can offer you the help you need.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've been learning to control those feelings. if meditation has taught me anything is that the best way to deal with emotions is to look at them and not judge them. i've noticed these feelings have been decreasing in intensity since i started meditating on them. it takes practice, that's why you should meditate, but it helps so much to have this ability. now it rarely feels overwhelming but it can feel like it sometimes. i just sit with it and feel it, not going down the thoughts but just looking at the emotions. in the end there's always a root cause for jealousy, in my case and i think what it usually is it's low selfesteem. dealing with that is tricky and i'm still figuring it out. you should really find a therapist to help you with this. i have terrible anxiety overall and i'm trying to approach it piece by piece now. it takes a lot of work but i think i will be able to overcome all of it. and as these feelings of jealousy have been slowly fading, it can for you too. and don't worry too much if what i'm saying doesn't work for you, just don't stop looking. ps even if you think meditation doesn't work for you at first, i really believe you should stick with it. it been proven for thousands of years that it does in fact work.</data>

  <data key="d1">then i think its time to up the dosage or try another ssri. you might also want to check if the way youre feeling matches the symptom of depression. and if youre just using a general doctor, then try an actual psychiatrist for med management. i tried cbd, but i dont feel like it did anything. did you ever try meditation? i found it challenging in a good way to see if i could keep my mind clear for just five minutes. it was hard!!! i prefer the apps to the classes since they are free of the eastern religion stuff.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes, i've had experiences with this too. i distinctly remember leaving a class in college, feeling so selfconscious, like everyone was watching me. my legs were almost numb and it was hard to move them properly. i had another experience when i tried to pick up bike riding. i felt like everyone was looking out their windows the first time i got on i already knew how to ride, and my legs got very heavy and i couldn't steer the bike. i kept having to get off and on again, which made my anxiety worse. honestly, it helped to kind of laugh at myself. also, remind yourself that people are probably not noticing your walk the way you are. just keep at it, take deep breaths, maybe stop to let yourself process what's happening, gain some perspective, forgive yourself for being weird, and continue on. it's definitely a strange sensation but i have read it as a side effect of anxiety. thankfully, it's been several years since i've experienced it, and i think it has a lot to do with laughing it off. overthinking it just made me more selfconscious and frustrated.</data>

  <data key="d1">relatable. i used to be super self conscious and awkward as well in public places. what helped me was my perspective. i realised when i noticed myself in public places watching others,from here to there, capturing everything in my surroundings unconsciously, ya know? also, staring at others. like, there are times when i might end up staring at others blindly. but i'm not really thinking about them. i'm more like in my own mind, thinking entirely something else. it's the same with other people. they might stare at you, might watch you for a sec before doing their thing, that's it. no one bothers about thinking of random person walking by. that helped me changed my perspective in a way, to make myself less concious in public places. i don't feel as uncomfortable as i used to feel before.</data>

  <data key="d1">i had severe anxiety and wellbutrin made it literally unbearable. like stay home everyday because of panic attacks and do nothing because youre so overwhelmed. i have severe health anxiety so i think a large part of the problem is that i was already terrified to take medication and then was convinced it was killing me. needless to say i took it for only a week and have now been on zoloft for two years and its been the best decision of my life. however i do have several friends that took wellbutrin and it worked great for them so i think it was just a dud for me.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm a fellow car crash survivor, i was a teenager, and it was quite bad too. i had some delusions for a while, but they passed with age, and i had obsessive compulsive traits unrelated to that, as well as a general anxiety disorder. i was an adult when i began talking to a therapist, and it took him a long while over a year to finally recommend me to see a psychiatrist and get an anxiety medication prescribed, and it helped a lot. i'm not sure what your therapist means by this is fine because she knows more about you and your situation, and it's true that to a degree intrusive thoughts are fine and they generally subside when you stop worrying about the fact that you have them. i still recommend visiting a psychiatrist if you can.</data>

  <data key="d1">is this an apartment complex? what kind of complaints are you launching with the city, landlordproperty manager...? this kind of thing really grinds my gears big time. depending where you live, there are laws protecting tenants from this very thing. it depends on how far you're willing to escalate it. but incessant noise from neighbors can become a big issue over time, especially if it's leaving your mother chronically fatigued. that kind of thing can snowball into bigger issues. if you're in an apartment, condo, duplex, townhouse, etc. and in the us, you have a right to quiet enjoyment. state laws vary on how it's dealt with once you make an initial complaint to whoever you're renting from. it's more complicated if this is a nextdoor neighbor in a separate house, and i sadly don't know enough about that situation to tell you much except to get your official complaints in on record, in writing, and maybe think about having your mother start a log for each occurrence.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'd start by checking out local laws and document everything in the meantime. one thing landlords love to do in my experience is assume that people don't know their rights. if you can educate yourself enough, that can sometimes be enough to get them to take action and stop dragging their feet. so let's say hypothetically you can file 3 formal complaints with the city before they'll start issuing fines, that's something you can make sure the landlord knows you know, if that makes sense. the city itself can be very pleasant to deal with or behave similarly to a landlord assuming you don't know your rights or aren't willing to escalate things. it really depends on where you live. if they're being helpful, i'd continue politely pressing them to do something about it and take it as far as they can. it could be these person's dadthe owner of the house will get sick of his sontenant causing trouble for him and do something about it. man, this one really hits close to home to me. i'm in the midst of dealing with a terrible, loud, inconsiderate neighbor and i have noise anxiety like your mom. plus i'm a super light sleeper. plus i have noisetriggered ptsd. i can totally sympathize with the hell your poor mom is experiencing in her own house. anxiety or not, no one deserves to be bothered in the home they pay for and seek peace and quiet in.</data>

  <data key="d1">you need to find out of the noise is excessive or if your mom is just anxious about sounds in general. there are decibel apps you can download on your phone. if the noise is excessive and truly disturbing, call the police every time it happens. and i do mean every time. keep a paper trail so log it every time it happens. if that does nothing, talk to a lawyer. that paper trail can be very useful if you're dealing with a noisy neighbor when it comes to lawsuits. and sometimes, a strongly worded letter from a lawyer is enough to get a landlord even one who's related to the tenant to fix the problem. you may also want to call animal control because of the dog. that can be part of the paper trail too.</data>

  <data key="d1">it could be a number of factors. some medications can interfere. anxiety in general impacts male performance. you could also have low testosterone levels. also there are more ways to please your partner than penetration. oral sex is a good way to satisfy your partner. also assuming you are with a female sex partner clitoral stimulation will often be more satisfying than penetration. media has overblown the importance of genital size in sex.</data>

  <data key="d1">it is probably anxiety for the drugworries problems unsolved. i didnt understand if you are experiencing anxiety because of the cannabies but i heard thst sometimes it can give anxiety. try to talk to your doctor maybe that med its not the most adecuate for your body. try not to let your mind run into problemsas your other organs will followdistract yourself with something that you like,do sport,dont take tea or caffeine all the time,meditation and therapy also helps.dont worry tachycardia its completely normal in people with anxiety but if it persist more thsn 15 min you should check w the doctor just to make sure.take care</data>

  <data key="d1">im 28 and graduated with my bachelors 5 years ago. taking out student debt without a plan is a bad idea, so give yourself credit for thinking that through. college is not for everyone, but remember you are only 18 i assume. any decision you make now does not mean the rest of your life will be determined by that. just because your friends are going to college does not mean they will be more successful than you. you still need to work hard at whatever you do to be successful. take one day at a time, and dont be in too much of a rush. finish high school first. its smart to take some time off. there will be others who can help you apply to college if you eventually decide you want to go. also, so what if you fail miserably with real estate? you probably wont just take it as a learning experience.</data>

  <data key="d1">not sleeping or eating well. staying afloat in a postcovid world has made that largely impossible. i'm trying my best though. x200b i notice that the anxiety seems to manifest if i'm focusing intently on something, especially if it's fiddly or dangerous ie working in the kitchen with hot items, knives trying to do tasks requiring good fine motor control. it's like i tense up my whole body and then my leg starts to cramp up and hurt. x200b in terms of other health issues, i do have mild cp, but never had any spasticity or anything like this until recently. a lot of recent appointments seem to be writing it off as this when there's no history to suggest it. x200b they go away with the anxiety, too, which doesn't really track if it was something related to motor control. i would say in general i feel a bit shakyuncoordinated compared to this time a year ago, but i'm also pretty much constantly at a slow burn of generalized anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">have you tried meditating, exercising? maybe just baby steps for now if that helps. like grab a banana instead of chips, drink extra water in a day, make small decisions here and there. i think meditating might help as it can teach you how to stay present and breathe when you have anxiety attacks. if you use meditation to reduce tension in your body it could help with the muscle spasms. if you have access to therapistpsychologists thats probably best. they can really help you.</data>

  <data key="d1">depression and anxiety are very often comorbid, and people with autism are at a much higher risk of developing them and other mental illness than people without it. zoloft is one of the safest and most common antidepressants out there, youll be fine edit, not sure why i forgot to mention this? i took zoloft for 7 years, starting when i was 9, and had absolutely no side effects. i did build up a tolerance over time so i had to switch, but thats normal with antidepressants. its just an antidepressant, nothing special.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi! i took sertraline for about 68 weeks in julyseptember this year. i am high functioning anxious, but experienced my first depressive episode as a result of worseningunmanaged anxiety. so, i got out of my depression after about a week and a half, and my anxiety symptoms were noticeably reduced. i stopped taking it because i was getting therapy which was incredibly beneficial. was this offered to you? while it might not be for everyone, if you can get it on the nhs, you might not have much to lose. watch out for side effects though, while mine werent bad, i know a lot of people have suffered from fatigue or increased restlessness. good luck and i hope they make your life a bit easier!</data>

  <data key="d1">that's great you are taking some time off. and i agree with the other comment here, you have done nothing wrong, don't blame yourself for being passionate and hardworking towards a project. if anything, be proud of yourself for recognizing your body's signs for needing a break and taking one. i'd highly suggest simple breathing exercises. they calm your heart rate, decrease the blood pressure, and activate your parasympathetic nervous system. and with your bodynervous system calm, your thoughts follow. an easy one i use is breathe in for 4 secs, hold for 4, breathe out for 4, hold for 4, repeat. there are plenty of others with a quick google, and even videos with visuals to help. and it can be hard to do breathing exercises during an episode of anxiety or panic, so i always think it's best to practice them even when you're not anxious. it's like a muscle, you have to practice and train beforehand so when it comes to game time high anxiety you are ready. then you'll be well practiced and you can calm youself easier during a moment of high anxiety. hope this helps and i hope you feel better!</data>

  <data key="d1">random thoughts like that about your kids possibly being kidnapped are something that somewhere around 95 of people reported having in one study out there in the world. it happens to most people. where the anxiety comes in is if you cant stop thinking the thoughts, that ruminating is an anxiety symptom. not being able to shut down your brain is a classic anxiety symptom. anxiety is normal. everyone gets it at times, it helps us survive. its also possible to have symptoms and not connect them to anxiety, it has happened to me. so, you could have some anxiety going on, but its okay. recognizing it should help you get to feeling better. therapy can help so much.</data>

  <data key="d1">you could potentially have hypochondria more so if you worry about your health a lot i worry about every single thing related to my health and i once went through a phase just like you, i went to the hospital, got multiple tests done, all came back fine and i was still convinced i was gonna die from a heart attack or something. 2 years later i'm here, completely fine. you just have to try and trust doctors as much as you can, the chances that they give you incorrect results are probably very low and if they believe nothing is wrong, then nothing is probably wrong. you'll get over it with time, my phase continued for quite a long time but i eventually just forgot about it and moved on to worrying about other stuff.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey. i also had hypochondria since 2yrs. although now i'm almost over the fear, before i always had to rush to get a doctor's opinion that i have nothing wrong. i still get worries about it but nowadays i can calm down myself saying that i have nothing wrong.</data>

  <data key="d1">same thing happened to me after eating a potent weed edible 3 months ago and ive had plenty of physical anxiety symptoms since. sometimes its manifesting in my heart, my head, my chest or tingles. i feel like im just beginning to really recover from the anxiety it left me with. i went to the er, gp, neurologist and cardiologist. i also did blood work and everything was perfect. ive been in therapy for a few weeks and see an np psychiatrist. its gotten better but i still fixate on my heart even subconsciously and sometimes i have chest pain all day. the first few weeks it was so bad it was keeping me up at night. it is a vicious cycle and it is anxiety. i know the heart rate is hard to ignore but when you feel it you have to remind yourself its just anxiety acting up and shift your focus to something else, reminding myself of this has made me feel it less and my heart doesnt palpitate as much. youre not going crazy, i thought i was going crazy too thinking i was imagining all these sensations or that i damaged my brain with the edible...its just bad anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">yup. i get it very severe too. i used to be unable to go even a few hours without diagnosing myself with a terrible life threatening disease. it doesn't help that chronic anxiety can cause terrible physical symptoms and stuff such as memory loss. i cannot state this enough tbh. my advice would be to seek therapycbt may help? and a psychiatrist. with their help i have been able to cope a little better. i learned some coping skills with my therapist, which helps but it didn't help enough until i was put on a new anxiety medicine. my anxiety is treatment resistent, you name it and they've probably tried it. the only things that have worked were benzos, which i am uncomfortable taking due to past issues with them. i was put on gabapentin and i feel like within the past few months the symptoms have seriously decreased. i still get waves of the health anxiety, usually triggered by some sort of pain or mention of cncer, but outside of that, i've improved a lot. i wish you the best, health anxiety is the actual worst and i'm sorry you're dealing with it too.</data>

  <data key="d1">u gotta figure out whats triggering them first, then what caused that trigger to go off. this is what allows you to prepare for and even prevent the panic attacks from happening. they only last for 10 minutes or so for me and when i have them i like to just manage my breathing and slowly breath in through my nose and out my mouth to calm myself down. opening a window or two helps a lot also, maybe even some relaxing music. just remember that theyre only very temporary and once theyre over you feel a lot better</data>

  <data key="d1">i am not a mental health professional and my comments are based on a mix of experience, my personal beliefs, and advice i've gotten from actual professionals throughout my life. sounds like you both need to learn how to be more gentle with each other. when boundaries get pressed or people don't feel like their words are being validated that's often how arguments start. holding onto your beliefs is important, but, it's also important to allow others to feel validated. and let yourself be in a way that they will want to validate you. sounds like you guys both probably care a lot about each other. lovers spats usually stem from lack of 'good' communication, not lack of communication as the saying usually goes. you can have very different opinions about some things and still be very comforting to each other's needs. there just needs to be a safe zone in the middle that you two can meet at that nobody has to walk away feeling unheard or unloved. having a conversation like this with him might help you reach that place.</data>

  <data key="d1">the kicker is my anxiety also extends to fearing i've got terrible illnesses, but it also makes the testing for them if i have symptoms that much harder. luckily i have a doctor who has known me for a long time and knows when something needs to be looked into, or can tell when my anxiety is getting to me.</data>

  <data key="d1">make a list of when all the assignments are due so that you can plan backwards and see when you should possibly start them. ive found that putting all of my assignments into a kind of timeline helped because it made it easier for me to manage my work and time. i also found that when i do get assignments i try to break them down into more manageable tasks. are you worried about not having enough time to do your assignments or not understanding the work that youre going to do in class?</data>

  <data key="d1">ohh how do you make the timelines? i dont really know what im worried about tbh. i suppose everything. im mostly worried about the math class im taking, because its my worst subject. im not super worried about my art class, i mean, i guess i am a little, but for that im mostly worried about the amount of work i may have. plus, i havent been in school since i dropped out of high school like a decade ago, so thats not helping.</data>

  <data key="d1">for me as someone with formerly debilitating anxiety that made all forms of work take ten times longer and a lot of distress, i was more functional on xanax than ive ever been. very calm, very focused, very high functioning and damn near anxiety free. it was like even when i tried to worry about something i just couldnt because my anxieties went blank. then i slept for hours and was knocked out cold for almost a whole weekend. i definitely think its the right thing for some people. dont take frequently more than once every week or two id say and you wont be at risk for dependence.</data>

  <data key="d1">thanks for sharing your story. i don't really have any advice i just wanted to say hi. i have had mental health problems and i found mindfulness and compassion focused training to really helpful. you might be able to find therapists who focus on that. a book i would recommend is 'the mindful path to selfcompassion freeing yourself from destructive thoughts and emotions' by christopher germer. its on amazon. feelings of unworthiness are a normal reaction to your childhood, but you can overcome this, you are young and there is a lot of help out there. don't let go of the dream, be prepared to go down some blind alleys, but if you persevere, i believe you will get there. i would also suggest trying to find a hobby you are passionate about. i know you are probably thinking i have bigger problems than hobbies. and you do. but interests and passions and being able to enjoy parts of the day are just so important. something that allows you to take a break from your problems and life situation. funny how i said at the beginning i didn't have any advice but then dished out loads. but i hope it helps!</data>

  <data key="d1">thanks for the reply but im not worried about an overdose. i stopped taking them yesterday and needed to know how many klonopin to take daily so i dont seize and can quit these damn devil benzos. i got some good advice elsewhere but thanks. my advice to people is if your doctor ever prescribes fast acting short halflife benzos turn them down. you will become addicted and start buying them and taking more and more. if you run out suddenly theres a huge chance youll have a grand mal in 23 days and you better hope youre lucky enough to be at home with your spouse like i was and not driving or working. theyre evil.</data>

  <data key="d1">protect your peace friend! when i went into labor with my son, i only told my mom and my motherinlaw both hubby and i come from split families and when hubbys stepmom found out, she called us to yell at us for not including her while we were still in the freaking hospital. she didnt call us to congratulate or ask how baby and i were doing, they only cared about themselves. not telling people until a few days after was the best decision i made for myself. i couldnt have handled the anxiety of trying to take care of everyone else while needing to truly focus on myself. having a baby is stressful enough, you dont need to worry about coddling the feelings of those around you right now. once they placed my son in my arms all my anxiety about everyone in the waiting room and everyone i hadnt communicated with melted away bc in the moment i only felt the need to protect my peace and my sons peace. son is 1 12 now and since then ive focused on only protecting us and its been the best decision ive ever made. im not sure if this helped at all but i hope it did a little. also, congratulations on your baby! sending you good and peaceful vibes friend!!</data>

  <data key="d1">brain aneurysms typically cause such intense pain that they separate themselves pretty quickly from typical headaches or head pains. another thing to keep in mind is that your anxiety is spiking, which means two things 1. youre likely to experience physical symptoms 2. youre likely to overthink those symptoms and mentally turn them into life threatening situations. aneurysms are terrifying, no doubt. also a fear of mine. maybe during my next episode you can talk me off the ledge. but for now, drink some water, take some ibuprofen, and try to get some sleep. if the throbbing is still there tomorrow, make a doctors appointment. but dont panic. you know in your logical brain that youre okay. listen to him instead of your anxiety brain.</data>

  <data key="d1">the head pains sound like sudden onset migraines, cheerfully known as suicide headaches. they are a sign of stress. they don't kill you. i've had mine 20 years. aneurysms are caused by weakened blood vessels in the brain. they are almost always hereditary. any of your close family 1 or 2 levels away died from them? if not, it's unlikely you will. so relax.</data>

  <data key="d1">scheizophrenia also has a lot to do with over stimulation and hearing really faint noises. the voice in your head would also be triggered by ur auditory nerve so it feels like ur actually hearing the voice on some level than it being the voice in ur head. you may just have anxiety and ocd. i mean i used to do that when i was younger and not so sure of my self.</data>

  <data key="d1">everybody is so different, it's hard to give specific advice. i am not currently medicated for anxiety, but am working with my doctor toward an official diagnosis and treatment plan. my so wants to help, but just can't understand it. i think the biggest, most frustrating thing for me is when he tries to make suggestions for how to deal with my anxiety andor things related to it. i know he's just trying to help, but it comes across as incredibly condescending and out of touch. like today he suggested i just make a daily todo list and then whatever i don't get done in a day can just be moved to the next day. as though having a growing list of all the simple things i can't do would make me less anxious. i imagine your wife is probably feeling something similar. she knows she should be able to clean an oven on her own. having her husband offer to do teamwork because she's incapable of doing it herself probably brings up all kinds of unpleasant emotions. anyway, sometimes just a simple how can i help? or even just can i help? is the best way to go. talking about dealing with the anxiety itself is important too, but not usually helpful in the middle of an anxietyspiral. if she's already upset and anxious and feeling worthless, bringing that up probably just adds to those feelings for her. try approaching it in a more calm time i.e. when you haven't just had a fight about her anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">thanks, but i don't want to just help by cleaning the oven... as that just feels enabling to me. i want to help by cleaning the oven and be part of 'how do you not feel worthless by your self inability to clean the oven? and in part, it's the dramatic increase in the frequency of these anxiety episodes that worries me.</data>

  <data key="d1">my therapist taught me that many times, anxiety looks like anger, even though we're not angry. if i was trying to clean the oven, but my anxiety was keeping me from doing it, and then my so asked me if he could help me, but then i yelled and screamed that if i wanted help i would've asked, this would be the reason i'm embarrassed, i feel guilty, and full of self hate and angry at my anxiety that i can't clean the oven. unfortunately, however, this is not what it appears, and it's not fair for my spouse to have to figure this out. so i have to work on building my selfawareness to see how my anxiety is coming out toward others. it's challenging, especially in the moment. but if i see it afterward, i can apologize and try to explain without it being an excuse to him why i reacted like i did, what i was thinkingfeeling, and let him know i'll try to do better next time. i also need to work harder at reminding myself that feelings and thoughts lie, and i'd be better off if i didn't listen to them. i'm not sure she really means to blame you for making things harder. in my personal case, if i said that to my so, it'd be the anxiety talking. it's hard to explain. i hear what you're saying about wanting to deal with how you feel like you're just the clean up crew for her anxiety, and you want to talk about it. if it were me, i'd prefer that my so bring that point up when i wasn't feeling anxious.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have. profusely. i sent him pictures of some of my journal entries after the breakup he was surprised at how much turmoil i was in. i can't turn back the hands of time. that's no longer my intention. i've taken accountability , at this point, am willing to say it was all me. i pushed him away, i pushed him to maybe seek something else that wasn't me, because i was too damaged maybe. it's nice to be in an easy relationship. i get it. but i have apologized, and he says he forgives me. it's the forgiving myself that's hard. i just wish i had been braver. if i had said, hey, i'm having some really crazy thoughts i think i need more help than i'm admitting.....i tried to manage it all myself for so long. for too long. i journaled, watched videos every day, read books, meditated. by the time i started therapy then eventually medication for my anxiety, i had hurt him with my constant pushing him, testing him. i wasn't doing it on purpose, but it doesn't matter. so, now, i just come to terms with this part. thank you for responding. i appreciate it.</data>

  <data key="d1">so i've recently done a cbt course where they did a guided meditation session called progressive muscle relaxation pmr. essentially it guides you through the body, tensing and releasing the muscles. i had a real issue with jaw clenching before and still do from time to time, but the techniques learned help me ease it a lot quicker. i don't always do the meditation as a whole, just snippets but it's definitely worth a look. i imagine you could find it on youtube.</data>

  <data key="d1">you have a medical condition, there is nothing wrong with taking medication for it. you are not weaker than someone else who doesn't need it, they aren't stronger than you are or trying harder or whatever. the stigma around it harms the people who could benefit the most from meds, and causes people who do perfectly well on their medication to try to stop it for no reason other than i shouldn't have to use it and lo and behold, their anxiety comes back without the medication and they suffer unnecessarily...because it's a disorder and some people need the medication to fix the problem with their brain so they can function. there is no shame in that, your anxiety is not your fault. it is something that is out of your control and by choosing to take your medication, you are taking control back and refusing to let your anxiety win. it is a medical condition just like any other, like diabetes or arthritis, and there's no reason to suffer needlessly without your meds when there is help, just waiting for you to take it. as for running out like every other medication, you can easily prevent running out of your medication simply by keeping track of how many pills you have left and scheduling a followup appointment for your refill when you have 710 days' worth of pills left.</data>

  <data key="d1">whats the difference between a recovery buddy and therapist other then they're just different people? i think this is a good idea for some people, but i think other then internet friends it'd be hard to find someone like that you can see in person and who wouldn't talk down or belittle you in some way about your anxiety</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm just here to offer a kind word and support. it sounds like you're under the care of a doctor, and i hope you remain under their care. and i don't know if anxiety can explain all of your symptoms. but anxiety can take a massive, massive toll on your physical health. sometimes just learning how to breathe can cause physical shifts in your body. i recently bought this little bamboo tube designed to help you breathe better. you breath in, then exhale through the tube which forces you to exhale in a slower, controlled manner. sometimes my heart stops thudding and the dread in my stomach goes away after i use that little thing for just a couple of minutes. i really hope you get some answers from your doctor soon, just advocate hard for yourself and keep pushing until you get some help.</data>

  <data key="d1">a i feel the same way sometimes. i struggled with mental health in the past and am still taking medication. being an empathetic person is a wonderful trait to have but i can see that sometimes we take people's problems and experiences to heart and causes us to feel down too. i'm so sorry you're feeling this way. i felt the same when my friend told me something bad that happened to her. i couldn't stop crying and couldn't sleep for days. something that helps me is to talk about how i feel to my mom or friends. i also try coping mechanisms like self care, watching a movie, painting, listening to music, etc... i hope this helps a bit, but just know you're not alone and that you are a strong and caring person .</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm glad i'm not alone, and i try to do that too, but sometimes it's hard to allow myself to enjoy myself or get more than them without feeling guilty knowing they don't. i just don't like it when it's not fair. i don't want more than others for hecks sake for me it also helps to talk, the problem is that i'm really embarrassed over this issue, and alot of people tends to just say don't be so caught up in others issues, or it's not your problem, get over it! or similar. it's not that easy to just get over it when it get's stuck in my mind and i just can't stop shaking and contemplating it. don't you think i would've done just that if it was that easy??? when people say such it honestly makes me feel like an idot. there are a few people i can talk to about this without being judged luckily. but that's very few. most people just don't seem to understand this. it's kinda weird to them in a way if you know what i mean. anyways ty for your support, it means alot for me 3</data>

  <data key="d1">hyper empathy is such a blessing and a curse. i hate crowds and being around certain people because i just get overwhelmed with all their emotions. i cant imagine being in a psych ward with this. ive found meditation to be really useful in knowing when youre feeling someone elses emotions and separating them from yourself a bit. if you can notice your patterns it can provide insight on how to avoid or manage such situations. it can be really difficult though to sift through all the emotions flowing through you to find your own when you get lost but its not impossible. youre not alone dont forget that!</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you, and i have been in the phsyciatric ward many times, altho this wasn't rly an issue with me until i experienced what i suspect was vicorious trauma when talking to a person ik irl about her though situation, ngl, i miss when this wasn't an issue and i could be more sympathic than empathic. but yeah, being in the psych ward after getting this anxiety has been difficult, especially high security ones. this also causes me to get very anxious when people are screaming and banging etc. like for example at the psych ward witch has happened alot. i also tend to avoid certain people just like you do. if somebody causes me to have an episode of hyper empathyanxiety i tend to avoid them as much as possible in fear of having another episode as they can take everything from hours to multiple days for me to get over it. in worst cases it can even take weeks or months. when i talked to that girl who caused me to have the vicarious trauma it took me 3 months to get over it, and to this day it still comes back at me at times. atleast there is one good thing about it, atleast for me, it always goes over naturally at some point, altho it is awful when it is going on, and it can be very exausting at the worst episodes. i think i forgot to mention this, but for me the severity and lenght of the hyper empathic anxiety episodes vary alot depending on the trigger. altho having multiple triggers at once, especially from the same person, usually makes it worse, hence why i aivoid these people.</data>

  <data key="d1">thats interesting usually during stress empathy is dulled but youre the opposite. ive read that you can actually develop ptsd through the trauma of another maybe thats what youre experiencing? during some of the most difficult times in my life ive sort of inverted my empathy to find weaknesses in others instead of using it to nourish relations which is its evolutionary purpose. i found that honing it like skill has given me more control over it and a very useful skill for helping those i love. part of this is shifting it from being emotional to being cognitive empathy which is conscious understanding of how it feels to go through what the other person is. it can still be overwhelming in this form so to speak but theres more wiggle room to know when youve hit your limit and need to remove yourself from the situation.</data>

  <data key="d1">she's your friend, though. and that's worth a lot! the thing with finding a partner is to not think about what they do for you. that's selfish thinking and will only lead to you pining for others. instead, look for chemistry in someone else. just flat out amazing chemistry. but more than that, find someone whom you make just ridiculously happy. this requires that you stop thinking about what you need, but rather, requires that you think about what the other needs. when you focus on the other and not yourself, then you're more likely to experience joy. granted, if the other just doesn't reciprocate, then you don't have a good match. but maybe they're a good friend. keep the good friends. always keep the good friends.</data>

  <data key="d1">i wouldnt try to deceive your doctors. be honest, those are strong meds and if you feel better off them then let your doctor be an informed and objective third party to reaffirm that. youll probably get scolded for lying about your meds but it is what it is. honesty is always the best policy when it comes to your health.</data>

  <data key="d1">42f. i have this, for sure. it started with some negative experiences and false diagnoses at my thenobgyn, so i started to get very anxious about going to appointments. but it happens with an athome monitor, too, until i calm wayyy down then the bp is typically normal or high normal. it's so bad that i avoid going to the doctor if i know they'll take my bp. i'm in good health but do see therapists and am on medication for anxiety. this is the thing i wish i could overcome, though. luckily my current obgyn understands the issue but i'm afraid my luck will run out soon and they'll put me on medication or order further testing. which scares the absolute crap out of me.</data>

  <data key="d1">visit a good psychist doctor. the problems on that side are always complicated and complex. it's not that it could be just your physical malfunction or psychic, it's all together, we're one organism. i'm glad you start to reflex on that. reflexing is a great thing, it makes you more conscious. try thinking about your life in a perspective of a real you. i mean, do you really like what you're doing? are you having enough fun? do you feel safe? when i went to school, i felt awful. i'm nonconformist and would argue with teachers all the time etc. especially if they were offending children, that's just making me angry. it's like a contrast, a battle in me. the anxiety and my nature of protester. i can't hold myself from protesting, but then i end up with lots of anxiety and a bit of health problems blood vessel issues. now, looking into past, i understand, that it changed me, lots of stress everyday, but my wife was saving me each day and videogames, movies etc. do you have things to run to from the badbad world?</data>

  <data key="d1">there are literally so many things that can cause fatigue, it's not really smart for people to say yes it's your anxiety just because fatigue can be a symptom of anxiety. things that can cause fatigue not sleeping enough sleeping too much not getting good quality sleep, even if your sleep duration is good having a sleep schedule that is not in line with your personal circadian rhythm. not eating enough several vitamin or mineral deficiencies including magnesium vitamin d vitamin b iron potassium poor diet quality in general being over worked exercising too much not exercising enough medications antihistamines cough medicines chronic diseases like diabetes obesity hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism sleep apnea stress fibromyalgia ibd depression copd anemia caffeine dependency that's just off the top of my head. my personal opinion, i would start at with the most obvious stuff, like sleep and diet, and see if you can make some positive tweaks there. in the mean time call your doc. routine blood work will cross a lot of causes off the list. personally, i used to get exhausted around 1 in the afternoon through the rest of the day. i started intermittent fasting, and it completely fixed the issue for me.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey you wanted advice right? if your nose is blocked as is all the time, go to a doc. but besides that breathing through your nose feels like breathing in a straw for everyone. its normal. it regulates how much you take in so your co2 levels stay within normal range</data>

  <data key="d1">i took benzos ativan on occasion for my panic attacks about once every week or two for 2 months and i did not experience any dependency. i think as long as its short term and not a daily thing youll be fine, try to make them a last last resort type thing and take small amounts. for me, just having the pills available helped relieve my anxiety because i knew if i felt a bad attack coming i would be okay, which ended up preventing most bad attacks at all.</data>

  <data key="d1">the way i think of it is that if your body is more used to being on the benzo than off it, that is when you risk addiction. so once or even twice every seven days should be fine, especially at low doses. ive been on that schedule for a few months now. no dependence whatsoever. it seems like your self aware so just keep that up and dont let yourself take them daily for too long.</data>

  <data key="d1">so iv got alot of experience with a similar start. if i could go back i would have never started taking it to begin with. my first runin with it i had just tried out just about every ssri out there, and ended up with effexor on top of adderall xr for adhd. somewhere in the course of the trial and error with the ssri's, i was prescribed .5mg klonopin. i imagine it started off like the second runin i had with it, but that part of my life turned into a big blur. oh anyway at first i only took it when needed. yeah right. when it solves every problem i ever had mostly because i didn't give a shit about my problems while taking them it wasn't very long before i always needed them. what i didn't anticipate was my tolerance. the same .5 made me feel well idk not so great. here's where i made it really bad.. i took up the hobby of drinking, like a 30 pack of beer and a half gallon of vodka every week type of hobby. over the course of that year, i ended up at 2mg every day. it wasn't till my mom came to the prescribing dr one day with me that i ended up not being prescribed it anymore. i don't want to think about that time in my life. even with a taper off of it every step down was agony, and that's putting it mildly so i got off the booze and off the klonopin and i decided that i didn't like my dr anymore so i found a new one and instantly had a fresh prescription. that time i was smart about it and didn't take it more than 2 days in a row. soon that became taking it for 2 days then skipping one day. that's great till you end up with a few extras and i would have been better off taking them as prescribed. this time i only worked my way up to 1 mg over the course of a year and a half. i left the booze out of the equation and i think that's why it worked so well. i distinctly remember both times after no longer taking it for about a month moments of clarity. i was reflecting on some life events and then i got to the period of life while taking those things. those memories the few that i did have were so foggy and blurry. it's been almost a year since i touched one, and i really hope i never touch another one again. tldr my borderline incoherent rambling to try to save someone's time, to help them understand that one is too many, and that a million are not enough.</data>

  <data key="d1">its really hard to limit these meds. the right dose is 0. i have panic attacks as well, and ive found that taking these even once while panicking turns into a terrible cycle. if you must, keep your usage of them short term until stress resides and only take them when you have tried to calm yourself down in every other way possible and this has not worked.</data>

  <data key="d1">note that many actually end up with more panic attacks once they start using benzos. your body can actually lose the ability to calm itself and thinks it needs a benzo every time you get worked up. less than once a week is ok, but stop taking it if you notice your anxieyt getting higher on days you don't take it.</data>

  <data key="d1">i take fluoxetine 40 mg daily that helps with the chest pain, and fluttering gut, i have to do a lot of other nonpharm things to manage my stress. ive tried stopping the zyrtec but i would just spend the day itching and since i tolerate the medication very well figured it wasnt worth the discomfort of itching all day so i just take it daily now. if your itching is episodic, you could ask your doctor about hydroxyzine its an antihistamine thats also used as needed for anxiety. it could make you sleepy however so be aware of that i dont ever wanna advocate treating anxiety as needed so maybe consider something longterm if youre open to it, and or therapy, and have the hydroxyzine for breakthrough episodes thats my two cents as someone with anxiety and a pharmd.</data>

  <data key="d1">similar to what im going through. i thought my anxiety spiralled as a result of the physical symptoms i have been experiencing weird sharp pains in my chest and back, chest tightness and sometimes a heartburn sensation. however, ive been months on a ppi with minimal improvement, doesnt seem impacted by food at all and im starting to actually believe the possible diagnosis of anxiety. i had been very stressed all of last year, but i truly believed the physical symptoms came before the anxiety this time. im frightened at the concept of trying anxiety meds as well...but dont know where else to turn.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi! i just want to start by saying i'm so proud of you for being sober for 5 days! that is a really big accomplishment and i feel like that's especially true right now. also, i know how relapsing into something can feel like a failure but it doesn't mean you have no willpower, it doesn't mean you're not trying. it just means things are tough and i'm so sorry about that. i can tell how hard you're trying even though things are so hard and it's really amazing. i don't know if this is helpful because i know i can't know exactly how you feel, but i have had a similar experience in that there was a point where i had no hope and felt so alone and no one knew. and i also know how hard it is to reach out so i'm so proud of you for sharing this. i know it's such a cliche and probably feels not genuine but when i say it gets better i mean that from the bottom of my heart. i mean even when it feels impossible, like there's no point in trying, it can get better. if there's anyone you know who can support you i would recommend reaching out if you can, i know it's really hard but often when you get over the initial panic of telling them there's just relief that it's not just entirely your burden alone that no one knows about. you're incredible, i truly truly am proud of you for how strong you've been and still are.</data>

  <data key="d1">first of all, a big fat hug to you. vent. away. as much as you can. suppressing your feelings only makes it worse for you in the long run. youre allowed to feel angry, or hurt, or sad, or lost. thats ok, and its part of who we are as humans. do you have any friends who you can confide in? sometimes releasing all of that built up negativity helps you realize that maybe everything isnt as bad as you thought it was. im also a big fan of lofi playlists, but also see if you can find something you like and treat yourself to it once a week or a few times a week. maybe you just want to spend the day in bed, or maybe you want to go for a nice relaxing walk, maybe its cooking, or painting, or working out, whatever it is, take time to do something for you. it helps release any tension, and can give you mental clarity to deal with all the crappy stuff youre dealing with. best of luck weasel boat you got this.</data>

  <data key="d1">so you can ask your pcp to order the test, though if you're young some may be reluctant to do that just cus they're not updated on new info. another option worth it, is to go on walkinlabs and get a total tesosterone test bought and print it out and bring it to quest.</data>

  <data key="d1">i experienced exactly what you did in that sense. two years ago it started really suddenly. i was dealing with alot of stress, and my thyroid was somewhat getting dysregulated which i didnt know at the time. as for low t in men of this age, its hard to often know exactlyyyyyy whats causing it, so usually they just treat it if necessary. for me this all came with wild symptoms such as never before experienced social anxiety, intense fatigue, a sense that things seemed literally a lil greyer, no sex drivea feeling of apathy towards sex, panic disorder, anger, irritability, low iron, dizziness, weight gain, no ability to lose weight or gain muscle, etc.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey! definitely bring up how you are feeling with your doctor and if it not a therapist, try to get an appointment with one. it can be great to unload for feelings this way. do you know what you are anxious about? how much understanding do you have about anxiety? i usually recommend hope and a help for the nerves by dr. clare weekes. it was the first book that helped me when i was in a similar spot to you. i hope you find the strength to love yourself, forget you past, be in the present moment with calmness in you body and mind. the power to feel better is within you. i believe in you.</data>

  <data key="d1">they can help and when they do they lift a lot off your shoulders. but they aren't happy pills and aren't really meant to be a long term solution to the problem. as you said, dependency will probably happen. and if you're in a relationship, be sure to talk to your partner as you will probably experience sexual problems. if you start taking it, be sure to keep a sort of log of how you feel to either see improvement or not. unfortunately, these pills are a gamble and seema to only work for 1 in 3 people. but if you're ready to jump in, remember that the first weeks are gonna be bad and it should improve after. this is purely my experience on paroxetine. but it made me not care about anything, made dumb decisions because of it. also couldn't feel a range of emotions which, including love. and getting off them is hell, some experience effects way beyond quitting them. so i regret it personally, but didn't have a choice in the matter as i was pretty young.</data>

  <data key="d1">one should decide on their own wether they want to give it a shot as well. ssri can make you wat more or lower your hunger. it can go both ways. but there's a higher probability you'll have sexual problems. and not saying this will happen but there is a possibility that it can last beyond quitting, which in my point of view would put someone in a depression too. but these are possibilities, you may not experience them or long lasting. as i and you said, it's a gamble that no one can really predict as science doesn't even have a firm grasp how these meds work.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes, paxil. but an ssri is still an ssri. they might vary a bit but the risks are still somewhat the same especially when it comes to to the sexual front and pssd. no one really knows why the side effects are there, one would assume it's because of serotonin seeing that wellbutrin has a way lower chance of that stuff and different side effects, and i also think the chance is waaaaaay lower to grow dependent on it. but the meds are unpredictable in a way for example one can take sertraline and be fine, then quit, later on a year or 2, they try again and get a totally different experience. it's all a roll of the dice which is unfortunate. but no matter the ssri, there are things you can expect no matter which you pick.</data>

  <data key="d1">you can ask your doctor that you want to try something specific but that doesn't mean he'll agree to it. my argument is usually, they may know a bit more about meds but it's still your body and you have to live with it. and if you're talking about wellbutrin? that's an ndri, no serotonin, works through dopamin and norepinephrine. if you have anxiety one should warn you that it could worsen as it's possible to give you energy. didn't do much for me except that i didn't feel like eating, had hunger but didn't want to ear, the thought just was ugh... also for worsened tinnitus from it which didn't really turn back even when quitting.</data>

  <data key="d1">i also am very nonconfrontational and realized i needed to get better at setting boundaries even in a minor way for my life to improve. it was helpful for me to start with really small things, like asking my roommates to wash their dirty dishes when they forgot, before working up to bigger stuff like refusing work at my job that was outside my job description or i didn't have time for. listening to the podcast dear prudence also helped me reframe confrontation in my head from something i was causing and therefore i was a horrible monster ruining other peoples' day to a necessary normal part of going about life. the host has some great scripts for how to approach conflict in a variety of situations as well. good luck! it's really satisfying to be able to say no to things</data>

  <data key="d1">yay congrats!!! that's a huge step!!! i was super nervous and emotional for my first psychiatric appointment, even more than for therapy. i cried through most of it. my initial appointment was a three hour evaluation, she assessed me and confirmed all my diagnoses that my therapist had provided, we went over my family history and my own history, onset, symptoms, severity, what works and doesn't about therapy, if my anxiety and panic keep me from doing things, etc. i was asked what i find myself worrying about and couldn't really answer, said something like 'it's everything and nothing, isn't it?' i'd recommend writing out your own history beforehand, how often you experience symptoms and what kinds break it into categories by issue if needed like you would do if you were writing a post here asking for help, so you have time to think about it and don't forget anything. if you want you could even print it out and give it to the doctor. for the ekg and blood tests i suspect they are trying to rule out medical causes for symptoms one cannot be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or any other mental illness without first having medical causes for symptoms ruled out. chronic stress and anxiety causes tons of physical symptoms as well as mental and emotional distress. obviously, go to a doctor and get medical causes ruled out if you experience any of these on a regular basis. muscle tension, aches and pains, weakness, cramps, painless muscle twitches, jaw clenching chest pain or racing heart, heart palpitations, pounding heart, audible heartbeat temporary hair loss, particularly on the crown of the head telogen effluvium bodyfocused repetitive behaviors skinscab picking, lipnailcheek biting, hair pulling, bouncing of legs or wringing hands, tapping fingers, fidgeting, etc. fatigue, exhaustion, irritability, difficulty focusing, forgetfulness or trouble with memory, insomnia, nightmares or trouble sleeping, frequent sleep disturbances headaches, dizziness, weakness, lightheadedness, sweating or shaking high blood pressure rapid breathing or shortness of breath hot flashes or chills, feeling overheated or very cold nausea, vomiting, gas, bloating, frequent urination, stomach or digestive problems including diarrhea and constipation weak immune system, often getting colds for example as for what to expect, there are various assessments used to determine if someone has an anxiety disorder. if you go to a doctor or licensed therapist, they will administer or ask you to complete a scale such as the gad7 liebowitz social anxiety scale, trait anxiety subscale of the statetrait anxiety inventory stait penn state worry questionnaire and beck anxiety inventory bai in some places, you can only be treated if you meet medical necessity if you have a diagnosable condition and are deemed at risk of worsening or continued impaired functioning without treatment. there are several types of anxiety generalized, social, etc and only a therapist or doctor could give a definitive assessment and diagnosis, but this is the diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, just one of the types of anxiety. a. excessive anxiety and worry apprehensive expectation, occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities such as work or school performance. b. the individual finds it difficult to control the worry. c. the anxiety and worry are associated with three or more of the following six symptoms with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the past 6 months note only one item required in children. 1. restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge. 2. being easily fatigued. 3. difficulty concentrating or mind going blank. 4. irritability. 5. muscle tension. 6. sleep disturbance difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep. d. the anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. e. the disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or another medical condition e.g., hyperthyroidism. f. the disturbance is not better explained by another medical disorder e.g., anxiety or worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anxiety disorde phobia, contamination or other obsessions in obsessivecompulsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder, reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in anorexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety disorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder.</data>

  <data key="d1">you're welcome!! here's some workbooks you might find helpful cognitive behavioral therapy workbook antianxiety notebook here's panic disorder info a panic attack includes at least four of these symptoms panic attacks are not a requirement for gad panic disorder is a separate diagnosis that has its own criteria that must be met, which is as follows a. the individual experiences recurrent unexpected panic attacks, which are abrupt feelings of intense fear or discomfort that reach great heights within minutes, during a time in which at least four of the following symptoms occur palpitations, pounding heart or quickened heart beat abnormal sweating trembling or shaking instances of shortness of breath or feeling smothered feelings of choking chest pain or discomfort nausea or abdominal pain dizziness, unsteadiness, lightheadedness or faintness chills or hot flashes paresthesia numbness or tingling sensations derealization feelings of unreality or depersonalization feeling detached from his or her self fear of losing control or going crazy fear of death b. one or more of the attacks were followed by a month or longer of one or both of the following persistent worry about having more panic attacks andor their consequences e.g., having a heart attack a significant abnormal change in behavior in response to the attacks, such as ones intended to avoid unfamiliar situations. c. the disturbance cannot be attributed to the physiological effects of a substance, such as a drug or medication, or another medical condition. d. the disturbance cannot be better explained by another mental disorder, such as social anxiety disorder or specific phobia, which may involve panic attacks. if you have panic attacks, these things will help you take your focus off your panic and bring you back into the present, ending your panic attack a bit quicker count backwards from 100 by threes, write your name with your nondominant hand or sing the abcs in your head, but skip every other letter. this takes enough focus that it takes your mind off your panic and helps end the panic faster. look for things around you 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, 1 thing you can taste. it's a grounding exercise, called the five senses. inhale deeply, hold your breath for a bit, exhale deeply. technically this is the 478 method. inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds. the length of time isn't super important, the idea is just to breathe more deeply as panic makes you breathe shallowly and lack of oxygen makes it much worse.</data>

  <data key="d1">jigsaw puzzle usually help me calm down a little bit after a particularly bad anxiety attack. i like to turn on a show, something lighthearted and funny my go tos are the office, parks and rec, community, brooklyn 99 and superstore and just work on a puzzle. i also enjoy reading, though sometimes i have trouble focusing. sitting outside and reading on a nice day usually perks me up a bit. im not much of an exerciser but i do like to sit outside and read or scroll through reddit. i try to find one small good thing in every day. for example, today i killed a hinox in breath of the wild with a bookshelf, and it was pretty funny . i hope this can help a bit. also, i do try to walk away from bad triggers that i can control. graveyards always spark just horrible anxiety for me, and so if i go for a walk, i dont go near the graveyard. i know its important to face your fears with anxiety, but its also okay to not face them right away.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey! this is called a bodyfocused repetitive behavior same category as nail biting, lipcheek biting, hair pulling etc but may cross over into dermatillomania territory, which is a separate diagnosis often comormid with anxiety disorders, exacerbated by stress and anxiety. you might find a spinner ring helpful, looks just like jewelry but you can spin it around your finger to relieve the urge to pull. or speks magnets. i also have success with baking and cooking, making pasta from scratch satisfies the urge for a while. therapy is very helpful. that is the only way to get a diagnosis and help, dermatillomania is very hard to treat. the most successful treatment is replacement behaviors, and i found a lot of the fidget toys from the therapy shoppe to be useful as well.</data>

  <data key="d1">breathe. accept the fear. tell yourself you're excited about the sensations you are feeling in your body. say outloud, this is exciting. try to rewire your brain. if that doesn't help try the 5,4,3,2,1 method, name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste. it might help ground you a bit. most importantly, if you are having suicidal thoughts please reach our for proper help. your story isn't finished yet.</data>

  <data key="d1">chill. you are going to be alright. maybe if your panic reactions are getting thus severe its time to bring this up with your doctor. work on medication and coping mechanisms and push back against this crap. it sucks getting rolled by anxiety. ive been dealing with it my whole life. even right this moment. but, l haven't had a panic attack in quite a long time. its an ongoing fight but you got to stand your ground. you are smart enough to know this isnt how you need to feel, but your physiology isnt listening so the next step is to introduce something that can make it obey. maybe medication or a change in medication. maybe change in diet and evening activities. whatever it takes the answer is not too far for you to take hold of.</data>

  <data key="d1">everyone's bodies are different, so my experience may be different. i don't recall my psych telling me bupropion assisting with anxiety, only depression and adhd. in my case, it did in fact make me feel more anxious as a side effect. it also made me more tired, becoming irritable bc of it. my depressive thoughts also didn't really stop. again, this could be different for you! ask your dr. abt a lexapro generic. that's what i take for my anxiety and it has helped a lot. i've noticed while taking this, it makes you wanna eat more, so i would just monitor your eating habits while taking it. let the food actually settle in your stomach before you decide to eat more, even if your stomach is like grrr i'm still hungee. lexaproits generic totally helps with anxiety tho. i would've never been able to get and stick with a job without it. i still have some anxiety problems, but those can be helped with therapy. i can at least go out in public and interact with strangers.</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you for sharing! it is going well so far, haven't noticed an increase in anxiety yet. i have been less anxious, but that could easily be because i haven't been in any anxiety inducing situations most of my anxiety is situational. it hasn't had time to really settle in yet either. i'll definitely keep lexapro in mind to mention if this doesn't work out!</data>

  <data key="d1">for me, globus sensation, which is feeling a lump in the throat. its like you take a pill but it gets stuck midway in your throat and it never goes down, no swallowing is satisfying, and if you panic you feel suffocating even though you can breath and swallow normally and without any pain. it feels real, it is annoying as fuck because it provokes constant feelings, which is hard to distract off from. im currently on my third week of it and it sucks. now i now 95 it is just on my mind and anxiety causing it. i have been on meds for a week, and i had days when it was gone, but it returns. i know it will go away but it is awful. i was annoyed by the other symptoms of anxiety like feeling nauseous, lack of apetite, lack of energy, strenght, feeling restless, heart racing, palpitations... but honestly, globus sensation is the weirdest and most annoying for me.</data>

  <data key="d1">does it give you the feeling of not being able to breath properly? or is it more an annoying feeling of something being stuck on your throat? saying that it's just in your mind i would say is a way of diminishing your feelings and illness. do you really think that its just in your mind and your fault, or is that something people have been telling you?</data>

  <data key="d1">it doesn't necessarily makes me not able to breath properly, but when it at its worse, it is very present, it is annoying to swallow, and even if i'm doing nothing, i still have the sensation my throat is a bit suffocated. like, im laying down at my bed now, and it feels my throat that normally had a radius of 5cm totally not real data, just an example, now have a radius of 2 with some walls touching, or something blocking, idk. it is not just psychological. i went to ent and he didnt see nothing wrong, but we couldnt do the exam that goes with a camera into my throat to see more, he will do one if it persists for a month. when i say it is on my mind, i mean it's my anxiety causing it. i feel maybe my throat muscles get tense somehow, loose or something, and it causes this. but when you read about globus sensation, it is very common for ents see nothing unusual there and have no recommendations. other times, there are reflux symptoms caused by anxiety or not that can cause globus too, so that they can help. but mine doesnt seem to be it. mine does seem to be anxiety related. from examples ive seen other people, most of them it went away after the anxiety got better with or without medication treatment and when they stopped worrying about it. but it can last quite some time until it is gone. im hopeful mine is gone soon because it sucks.</data>

  <data key="d1">6 as part of the official adoption requirements that i signed and agreed to with the shelter handling oliver's case, i open my home and make myself available on a daily basis for random housechecks and interviews from a qualified professional adoption coordinator whose job it is to identify genuinely abusive behavior clues through personal interviews and assessing the home and temperament of the animals in it for signs of newworse treatment or trauma, and negative environments and indicators they're trained to identify. we're on a firstname basis and i keep her updated with journaling, photographs, and videos compiled about my home environment with every single conversation or interaction, none of which she asks for because i volunteer it immediately upon greeting her because i'm usually very excited and proud of how things are going. this is a bump in the road that i now have a plan for ensuring never happens again, and since i started putting some of the very first new steps to work this morning, there's already a positive turnaround for all of us. this morning, sean even perked his ears and wagged his tail in excitement when oliver got out of his bed and approached both me and sean together at once. he didn't growl or snarl. he was genuinely perky and glad to see everyone waking up including oliver and hasn't taken offense to me petting and brushing oliver today, either. oliver's case worker's job is to either pull the plug on me having pets at all, which i also volunteered for, or put the rubberstamp on the adoption. i agreed to a 6week opendoor policy and agreed to random calls, checkins, emails, text messages, and instructions, which is still in place. i stay on top of keeping up with regular vet checkups, vaccinations, covid notwithstanding weekly trips to a professional groomer for more brushingtrimming and nail care, regular dental care on time with reminders sent to me by my veterinarian, and prophylactic screenings for agerelated congenital defects or disorders from heart murmurs to hip dysplasia, with every question at the end of an appointment being, so, is there more we can do to improve and how can we do it?</data>

  <data key="d1">i have a similar experience!! i am incredibly paranoid about someone breaking into my home. its never even come close to happening to me, but i just cannot shake the fear i have. things that help me deal with my fear is honestly making jokes about it! my family thinks im nuts sometimes because i love to buy home security equipment, but i just agree with them and move on because they allow me to keep adding stuff to the house so that i feel safer. when i can laugh at my self for stuff that i understand is irrational, it helps me feel a bit better about dealing with it. while this approach may not work for you, just remember that there are people going through similar situations as you. while my fear may not be the exact same, the emotions we feel, im sure are very similar. however, please know that what youre dealing with is not irrational, as many people have unique fears that cause difficulties in their lives. i am going to keep you in my thoughts and i hope tonight you are able to get some good sleep! p.s. theres never shame in rocking a night light! anything that helps you sleep is a great tool to have in my book!</data>

  <data key="d1">i have the exact same issue. i'm better now after moving in with my fiance however before that i lived alone abroad and my problem got so bad i started getting sleep paralysis nightmare which made everything worse. what helped me a little was not sleeping in complete darkness. like i left hallway light on so i can tell myself that it's not 100 nighttime and that it's as safe as daytime. and i also started playing a netflix show that i've seen 100 times before on low volume next to me. while the sound might make other people not fall asleep it actually helped relax me. something else really important do not watch horror movies, do not read scary stories and do not follow triggering subreddits. you'll think it's okay at daytime but when the night comes it'll all come at you, so don't give yourself the chance. something i also do if my mind is fixated on a scary storymovie is that i do something that is to me very mundane and grounding like browsing through instagram reels or even watching porn. i tell myself this is very human and dumb, no place for the paranormal here.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have the same fear as you. my dad used to not allow us to lock our house at night when i was growing up. he said if you lock your house, the fear will attract criminals to the house! yeah, that's as fucked up as it sounds. but anyway, i grew up being terrified all the time. i am 37 now and i sleep with a light on even though i definitely lock all my doors and have my entire adult life, but i still get freaked out. when i was in my lower 20s, i had to check every closet and under my bed, sometimes multiple times a night, to make sure no one was hiding in my house. i still check under my bed but just once and that's it. lol. i absolutely cannot watch those true crime shows or shows like law and order or dateline because i get terrified.</data>

  <data key="d1">thanks for the tip. it will only be alleviated if i sleep next to someone. i notice that when my sister slept next to me before. now that i am alone i get super jumpy and paranoid. you're right, i wasn't like this before and only got triggered after reading a scary story. does it mean that i will never get over this? did you ever get over your fear? also, does it qualify to being nuts? i mean, i'm not crazy but this paranoia and how it affects my mood i am often grumpy and angry in the morning due to lack of sleep makes me worry that i might be getting nuts. lol. i did what you did! i played spongebob squarepants just to provide some noise, but i've been turning and tossing. it's so difficult.</data>

  <data key="d1">woah thats pretty cool honestly. i wish i felt close enough to the spirit world that they were around me at night. if this were me id consider changing up your sleeping space. maybe there are things around you that you associate with these feelings. do you have a partner? if not maybe get one or add some light or posters or hell invite a psychic medium to party with your ghosts. sorry, i dont mean to diminish this at all i just envy your irrational fear. my irrational health anxieties are boring as fuck.</data>

  <data key="d1">some good resources already shared, but i wanted to add a trick i developed. it works with any health anxiety, but i started using it specifically when heart attack was my big fear copypasted from another comment i made in the past strange, sticking, screaming. our bodies are good at letting us know when something is wrong. doctors know the things that can happen more silently in the body like high blood pressure and check for them regularly. but the other stuff, when somethings wrong in our body, its generally gonna tell us. and it tells us we need to pay attention in one of three ways. the first is something strange. bodies have a certain range of fairly normal activity. much of it is intermittent and unexplained in the moment, but it is still normal. a random pain in your arm is normal. a headache out of nowhere is normal. a mild tremor is normal. dark red blotches all over your arms not normal. thats something strange. it doesnt mean its time to panic, but you have something concrete to investigate. this is an appropriate time to look up medical information on the internet but not obsessively. schedule a doctors appt. something strange is happening so you can pursue it. the second is something sticking. a headache is normal. a headache that doesnt go away for three days is not. when our body sends us the somethings wrong signal, it doesnt want to stop sending it until the problem is resolved. has something normal been happening for a clearly abnormal length of time? call your doctor and schedule an appointment to get it checked out. the third way is screaming. if youve never had a certain health condition, it can be hard to imagine the severity of it in the abstract. ive never had a heart attack or a stroke, so i started interpreting vague symptoms like mild ache in left arm and fumbling my words a bit as a sign something was seriously wrong. but in almost all cases, when the body is in crisis, it screams. it sends pain and discomfort you dont have the choice of ignoring. it was helpful for me to learn these common phrases of people suffering heart attack it felt like an elephant sitting on my chest, and stroke it was the worst headache of my life. thats a far cry from the things i was experiencing when i feared i was having these things happen. so as soon as i have a health worry, i ask myself is it strange? is it sticking? is it screaming?. if the answer to all these is no, then any doctor would tell me to wait to take action until one of those becomes a yes, so thats what i do. i thought through that so many times during attacks that now it happens automatically. i dont even process it. this let me remanufacture a rational response to the normal workings of my body and give me some peace.</data>

  <data key="d1">i go through periods of having insomnia, due to anxiety and chronic pain. it's very frustrating. one thing that helps me sometimes is, i stop trying to sleep. it can feed the cycle of anxiety. i make a list things i plan to do at night when i can't sleep. shows to catch up on, projects to work on, websites to visit for me personally, screens have zero affect on insomniaetc. having a 4 year old, i have very little me time during the day. i often find that as soon as i have fun things to look forward to doing at night, i usually fall asleep instead! everyone is different of course. i hope something works for you and you get some rest soon!</data>

  <data key="d1">please don't delete this. others need to feel they are not alone. this happens to me almost every night, multiple times. i think they are called nocturnal panic attacks. it scares the shit out of me when it happens as i wake up disoriented, jumping out of my sleep and don't know what the heck is going on and feel very disoriented. then sometimes i fall back asleep and it starts all over again. most times, the symptoms escalate because i was so startled that it moves into a full fledged panic attack with heart racing, gloom and doom feelings, terror, palpitations, and like i am not even in my own body derealizationdepersonalization feelings. these jolts make me feel sheer panic and then my adrenalin blows up and i want to run out the front door to get to safety or try to burn off the adrenaline. sometimes i wonder if these are miniseizures or something neurological that is causing it. these panic jolts suck and always make me feel physically and mentally exhausted.</data>

  <data key="d1">stress can cause sleep problems. try to not be so hard on yourself and try not to force sleep. not getting sleep increases stress, which makes sleep harder. practice good sleep hygiene and try to go to bed at the same time, and try reading a book or some activity that you know makes you sleepy. one night of no sleep doesnt hurt, even two nights you can still manage. i went 7 days no sleep and about lost my mind, but that is an extreme case. the way i sleep now is managing stress throughout the day and staying calm. it may take some time to recover, but practicing relaxation by deep breathing, exercise, walks, yoga can all help calm your nerves and allow you to sleep better.</data>

  <data key="d1">you have to frame your mind around not thinking or worrying about your hr. your brain is expecting it and thus activates your nerves at night to protect yourself. a beating fast heart is not a concern as your heart can handle it. as for sleep, youll want to continue meditation and practicing deep breathing so you can activate your parasympathetic nervous system which is the sleep and digest nerves. be patient as it does take time to unlearn the nervousness at night. try to be ok with having adrenaline and tell yourself its nothing to worry about. eventually, youll stop having it as you will stop worrying and thus no need for your body to overreact at night. good luck.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes, when adrenaline or stress starts, you have to let it burn off. fortunately, adrenaline is short lived, it should only take 510 minutes. if you have symptoms beyond that, then its an overactive nervous system thats stuck in fight or flight mode. beta blockers help reduce heart rate and blood pressure, but your nerves need time to heal if theyre constantly stressed over years of having these types of attacks. meditation is there to help you establish a baseline of calm and to practice manually controlling your calm so you can return on command. but you will need rest, patience, and time for your body to heal fully. exercising regularly will also help establish balance in your hormones and chemicals and eating a healthy diet will stimulate positive healing and thoughts. keep trying new ways of relaxing and calming yourself until you find something that works. good luck.</data>

  <data key="d1">i take ativan too only as needed. it blocks that feeling of dread you get in your stomach from anxiety and before you go into panic but it doesn't stop the thoughts. i read that lorazepam ativan stops your brain from releasing that certain chemical that lets you actually feel the panic. i'm no doctor or pharmacist but i think it stops the feeling of panic but not necessarily the state of panic itself.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah the iv version is the safest way of putting it into the body apparently. in crystal form, how it is often found recreationally, it can build up in the bladder and cause obstructions. it is also used as an antidepressant for people with severe untreatable depression whereby other medications haven't helped. it's a prescription drug in the uk, but you have to pay 150 for 28mg of nasal spray form. unfortunately this is leading alot to youngsters to abuse it because they just want to escape their minds for a little while. their daily use of it isn't going them any good though and it should always be discussed with a medical professional before use</data>

  <data key="d1">you have two pedals in your nervous system gaba and glutamate. think of glutamate as the gas pedal, and gaba as the brakes. lorazepam and all its benzodiazepine cousins, as well as barbiturates and alcohol, interact with gaba. gabaergics like ativan calm you down through relaxing your nervous system and allowing your feet to actually use the gaba pedal. your cns is shot when you have panic disorder or severe anxiety. but your cns is also shot when you use a lot of benzos. dangerous shit, though. i was a xanax fiend for a long time. withdrawal almost killed me.</data>

  <data key="d1">your heart beats in response to your bodys need for oxygen. it can also race if you are anxious. since you are carrying a lot of weight, it may help to adopt more exercise and try changing your diet to reduce your weight. that will give your heart less of a load to carry and make it more efficient. drink plenty of water so you arent dehydrated and stay away from caffeine or other stimulants. same for alcohol. if doctors have ruled out everything else, the best you can control is adopting healthy habits, sleeping well, exercising, and developing relaxation techniques to control your anxiety. good luck.</data>

  <data key="d1">you may be anxious about having a fast heart beat, which happens when you exercise. know that you can withstand up to 180190 bpm for short times. your breathing and body will tell you to slow down so you can catch your breath. anxiety can cause hyperventilation and fast heart beat as well. you can try to build confidence in your body and your ability to calm yourself. the dizziness and light headed ness, if happening often, is a sign of general fitness and thus you do need to improve it by starting small and working your way up. daily physical activity will improve your cardiovascular health and make it more efficient so it can pump blood to your head and prevent you from feeling that way.</data>

  <data key="d1">i get this too, i think its all part of the fight or flight reaction of the sympathetic nervous system brain perceives danger, you experience anxiety, your body reacts as if you were in physical danger. one of the reactions the body goes to is increasing waste output if youve heard of people being so scared by something they pee their pants, its the same thing, except youre experiencing it more gradually so you have time to process the need to get to the toilet. it is unpleasant but it is still important to be staying hydrated, so dont try to react by drinking less drink less caffeine and more water, gatorade type stuff. best of luck my friend sorry youre experiencing this</data>

  <data key="d1">hi, sorry to hear this has affected you. i also get the body shakes when i get super anxious. for me, its when im having a confrontational or uncomfortable conversation. its tricky because i cant speak because my body is physically shaking and i find it embarrassing, which in turn, makes it worse. a way that ive found has helped has been to deeply breathe into my diaphragm, and as i breathe out, focus on how my neck and shoulders are relaxing as i do this. it sometimes brings my nervous system down a couple of notches in the moment, so that i can take back some form of control over my feelings of anxiety and how it is expressed, and feel a little more present in the moment. in regards to the person at your work, would you be able to have a gentle conversation with them highlighting them to the fact that their assumption was incorrect and maybe let them know it was a little hurtful? it can be really liberating to share with someone when they have done something insensitive as it gives them the opportunity to take responsibility for what they have said, rather than you internalising it. the differences between peoples healthbodiesidentities etc is something that we are still learning to embrace and educate ourselves on as a society some people are less aware, some more so. this being said. if you dont want to or do not have the energy to have this conversation, you should feel no pressure or responsibility to do so. please do not internalise the comment made by your co worker, you are are complete regardless of how others see you.</data>

  <data key="d1">i will say that i can absolutely identify with this. i had a supposed friend who asked me, how's your parkinson's today when i was shaking due to terrible anxiety. it also hurt me especially so considering i thought i enjoyed their company. it's a derogatory, obnoxiously rude remark on multiple levels it puts your anxiety in the spotlight if you're like me, i also have a high degree of social anxiety for how others perceive me, so this is especially hurtful, it takes a stab at you for a supposed disability, and is also just ignorant of the many people who truly are suffering from parkinson's, which is a terminal neurologic diagnosis with no cure most people wouldn't joke about cancer, but somehow any neurologic or psychiatric disease seems to be fair game for jokesbut, i digress. i don't know if this is helpful, but at least i can say i have had a similar experience. know that they are just ignorant and not worth your time. the world is filled with people who will try to make you feel small at any turn. since you are coworkers, it is a tricky scenario, but if it happens again, it is worth thinking about having a conversation with said person about it. there's always the chance that they thought it wouldn't be received the way it did and they said it less as i'm going to be a bully and more as sort of tough love talk, not that i would ever talk that way, but some people do as friends.</data>

  <data key="d1">perfectly normal. panic attacks often come out of nowhere, but can have identified triggers as well. panic attacks are abrupt feelings of intense fear or discomfort that reach great heights within minutes, during a time in which at least four of the following symptoms occur palpitations, pounding heart or quickened heart beat abnormal sweating trembling or shaking instances of shortness of breath or feeling smothered feelings of choking chest pain or discomfort nausea or abdominal pain dizziness, unsteadiness, lightheadedness or faintness chills or hot flashes paresthesia numbness or tingling sensations derealization feelings of unreality or depersonalization feeling detached from his or her self fear of losing control or going crazy fear of death if you have panic attacks, these things will help you take your focus off your panic and bring you back into the present, ending your panic attack a bit quicker count backwards from 100 by threes, write your name with your nondominant hand or sing the abcs in your head, but skip every other letter. this takes enough focus that it takes your mind off your panic and helps end the panic faster. wash your face with ice water this triggers the diver's reflex. when we dive into cold water, our heartbeat automatically slows, blood moves from the limbs to the chest and breathing slows down. we can trigger this response without actually diving into water. washing your face with ice water should be cold enough to shock your body and break the pattern of panic. alternatively, try taking a cold shower. look for things around you five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, one thing you can taste. it's a grounding exercise, called the five senses. inhale deeply, hold your breath for a bit, exhale deeply. technically this is the 478 method. inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds. the length of time isn't super important, the idea is just to breathe more deeply as panic makes you breathe shallowly and lack of oxygen makes it much worse. there is one particular song that i loop when i'm anxious or feeling a panic attack coming on or trying to knock myself out of the postpanic hangover be still by the killers. it has this magical soothing quality for me, like musical xanax.</data>

  <data key="d1">i get them all of the time, they come and go with intensity. seek help if you feel compulsive to acting on them. try to avoid triggers, for example try to drive less, give someone else any weapons you have for a while, be around others more etc. if the triggers arent constantly around you it should help to silence them a little bit. also you can try to distract yourself with something mentally stimulating, that takes a lot of focus. im not sure what your interests may be but something like a video game or reading a complexfascinating book can help too. youre not losing it! for most people, theyll always have those thoughts but its about managing them and keeping yourself safe</data>

  <data key="d1">what's the point of having a doctor if you're not going to use them? every doctor tells you to call if you have questions or concerns they don't just say that to hear the sound of their own voice. if you don't like your anxiety medication, call the doctor and tell them, make an appointment to discuss other options, ask before you stop taking anything. you're never stuck with a medication that doesn't work or that causes weird side effects there are dozens of options. but if you don't act responsibly and use your doctor and act with caution, you're only sabotaging yourself and giving the doctor the impression you're an immature, irresponsible patient who perhaps can't be trusted with these types of medications at all.</data>

  <data key="d1">sounds like your anxious about being anxious as its been bringing negative symptoms to your life, and that is a vicious cycle fueling your daily struggle. its important to let it go and be the best you can be now and dont worry about the future or dwell in the past. also, you have low self esteem as you think others are holding it together better than yourself, which is a lie. we all struggle and just because you look at someone who seems to have it together, they are likely just better at hiding their struggles. do not compare yourself to others, it doesnt serve you in any way to do that. focus on being healthy physically and mentally and learn from your mistakes. forgive yourself and if you mess up, its ok, fix it and move forward. trial and error and practice will help you improve and make less mistakes, but you dont need to fear mistakes in general. there are many anxiety meds available if one didnt work out for you, as not all cause such depression symptoms and may help you as a temporary way to get you back on your feet, a crutch until you learn how to walk again so to speak. good luck.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've heard of that method before for calming anxiety but i haven't put it to the test yet because i haven't left my house since march and most of my triggers are outside. i've just recently been told another method though which you could also try. it's called the 54321. so, when you're in that state of anxiety, everything is overwhelming and you want the ground to swallow you whole.. take a moment to come back to reality by observing your surroundings and looking for 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste. this can also work for ptsd flashbacks. another method i've been recommended for both anxiety and ptsd flashbacks is to pick any item nearby and really concentrate on it. what is the object? what is it used for? what colour is it? how many sides does it have? what does it feel like? does it have a smell? does it have a taste? does it have a sound?... i've tried this method for ptsd flashbacks and it really helps to bring me back to the here and now.</data>

  <data key="d1">feeling better today. yeah, i could insist on not taking the medication, but i'm worried that i'll be giving in to an irrational fear, instead of running towards it. i'm going to keep taking it since it is considered a very safe medication and my cardiologist told me there will be no issues. i've also hesitated to take antibiotics and gi medication in the past due to an irrational fear of what it'll do to my heart, and i must overcome that. so i'm gonna stick with this for now.</data>

  <data key="d1">added the tldr. i've done that, i gave myself about 2 weeks and normally i'm an out of sight out of mind kinda person and after about a week of no contact, i'm good. this time after 2 weeks i still felt the same about him, in fact i felt like my feelings for him only grew, maybe the you don't know what you got til it's gone saying or absence make the heart grow fonder, whatever the case. but that's when i reached out again a few times and one attempt kinda worked but then he went back to ignoring me for his own protection until last night i was like alright enough is enough, wtf is going on? but his contradictions just raised more questions. the thoughts never stopped though even after 2 weeks of no contact.</data>

  <data key="d1">sounds like you are not a priority for him. that should be a huge red flag. its easy weve all done it to romanticize the good things, and diminish the bad things. gotta be careful with that, as it only makes us want to accept the person back, even if we know we shouldnt.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm just trying to find the line between being patient with his anxiety issues and my own. he's had a pretty messed up and abusive childhood possibly sexually abusive and i understand why he'd shut down and bottle things up when hurt. i don't want to say i could fix him, but we worked through an issue before by talking and he said it's the first time he had done something like that in 27 years. and it was find, we were laughing and joking by the end. but then there's my anxiety where when i think oh, maybe we can be friends again, he responded and he unblocked me from snapchat, he ignores me for like 9 straight days and i'm like...wtf was the point in unblocking me only to ignore me until i put my foot down and say uhm, wtf is going on here? and then it turned into a whole mess. ugh.</data>

  <data key="d1">i understand what youre saying. one thing that pops out is that as you noted you cant fix anyone. but more importantly, it may be that its the tip of the iceberg, and his issues run far deeper than a conversation or 100 can alleviate. i know its difficult to extricate yourself when you are still in love w someone, and you desperately want it to work. but, sadly, this is the struggle many of us go through when a relationship is over. its probably comfortable for him to have you as a friend. but youve got to look out for you, and move on. id say be his friend, but only after youve healed and can actually be just a friend. if he wanted you in his life, hed make that happen. it sounds to me like this is one of those situations where he takes you back, knowing hes not committed, because its comfortable and reassuring and sexual. but youre in it for vastly different reasons.</data>

  <data key="d1">so i'm not trying to be rude at all, i appreciate your comment! it's just very wrong lol. he's very inexperienced with women and it's kind of the opposite, feelings and caring about someone is uncomfortable for him, which is fine and dandy. but i just feel like if you're able to have sex with someone, you should be able to talk to them as an adult and answer some questions. this is less about me wanting him and more about me wanting answers. that's the part that's killing me, i need answers way more than i need him in my life, and that's not to say i wouldn't love to have him in my life. but even with him in my life my anxiety is just going crazy without the answers.</data>

  <data key="d1">i hope you are feeling better now, if not i can almost guarantee you its not a heart attack. my brain always goes to the same place. in my mind heart going fast and pain heart attack. short of breath lung failure headache brain tumor. its a vicious cycle you fear the symptoms in turn making the anxiety worse in turn making the symptoms worse. you just need to continuously tell yourself its just your anxiety. i know its so hard. i cant even do it for myself yet. anxiety makes life hell but you a stronger then it even when it doesnt feel like it ! you are gonna be okay. you are not having a heart attack. if you ever need some reassurance you can dm me anytime. i feel you completely. those kind of attacks are the absolute worst. stay strong my friend.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm so sorry you're going through this. it sounds frightening and tough. you will be fine. the good news is that it is probably just anxiety. i'm proud of you for getting it checked out just to be sure. i have similar anxiety around my heart health. same as you went to dr, ekg, labs...everything was fine. i've learned to trust that, but here's what i do when i feel that my heart is vibrating palpitations 1 i take my blood pressure to assure myself that it is ok. sometimes high, sometimes low, but never anything drastic. 2 i bought a blood oxygen tester like 35 and it just clips on your finger. this verifies that oxygen levels are fine 90100, usually 95 but test when you're fine so you know your usual levels. 3 i brought an apple watch which has a 1 lead ekg which assures me that my heart activity is normal. the latest apple watch also has the blood oxygen meter i believe. if you don't want to spend a few hundred, you can get one of those 2 lead ekg things from amazon. 4 when it is happening at night and i need to sleep, i turn a heating pad on low and hold it to my chest. the warming masks the palpitations and i can sleep. regarding 13 none of them really guarantee that i'm not having heart issues, but they give me some assurance and i remind myself that the dr said i was fine as well. again, you're gonna be fine. review this subreddit and you'll see plenty of folks with the same heart health anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">does shaking concern you? are you worried about being inefficient at work? best to try and let go of feeling like anxiety must be prevented and just let it happenwork through it. deep breathing exercises and relaxation in those moments will help. the more chronic the anxiety the easier to set it off. at my worst, i would get anxiety out of nowhere. my trigger was that i was afraid of anxiety and what it causes discomfort, fear, shame, burden to others but once i let it go and let it run its course, it would get better daily and lose its effect. benzo withdrawal can definitely amplify anxiety, but it is temporary as long as you stay off.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think i understand what you're saying. in a way, i was driven by my anxiety, propelled along. but it wasn't a pleasant feeling. now my anxiety is under control, with medication, i often lack the motivation to get things done, and tend to procrastinate a lot. obviously i still much prefer being free of anxiety. but it's an interesting observation nevertheless</data>

  <data key="d1">i thought this way as well. i recently got a new job for the first time in over a year and i was terrified. i was terrified to make mistakes, to fuck up, to get yelled at. i'm not invalidating your feelings by no means, i'm just speaking on my experience. i learned to take everything lightly, i know i wouldn't be able to do this as easy as i do now without medication, but it really does help. people make mistakes, and if you're a perfectionist it's understandable but you just gotta realize life is messy. nothing is truly perfect in itself. i'm here to tell you that other people don't view you as a nuisance or annoying, you view yourself that way. they are just reassuring you that whatever happens, it's going to be okay. i know it's not easy to retrain the way you think and to be nicer to yourself, but practice it a little more and more each day and it should get easier. it's gonna be a work in progress and some days will be harder than others but trust me it'll be worth it. sending good thoughts. love, someone that also hates their own head but has learned to accept it and try to retrain it.</data>

  <data key="d1">very normal it's commonly referred to as the postpanic hangover. as far as your body as mind are concerned you've been through a real trauma, though you know there was no real danger. rest, take care of yourself. take a nap meditate read a book, do some coloring take a hot shower or a cold one trigger the diver's reflex which automatically slows your pulse and breathing, moves blood from limbs to chest and sort of resets your body, take a walk drink some electrolytes gatorade or a powder supplement like liquid iv or a competitor. it can last anywhere from the rest of the day following the attack to a week or more, but will eventually fade away. for me, mine always made me exhausted and overly sensitive and emotional like a hair trigger, very irritable and on the verge of tears.</data>

  <data key="d1">i highly suggest to tell him to try cbd instead. there are some high quality strains that will get you high but its a different high. not cbd you usually get at your local smoke shop either, those are usually trash, i usually get mine online. i started smoking weed for the first time in my life about a year ago, in the beginning it was fun. i started to get away from the stress and it was great. but slowly i guess my anxieties about life were more overwhelming and the weed start giving me anxiety and panic attacks as well. then it started sending straight into panic and paranoia consistently. i didnt realize these were signs up until i guess i just followed the rabbit hole of anxiety and paranoia that led me to episodes of derealization. it was horrifying. i talked to my therapist and we just landed on the fact that i couldnt smoke weed anymore cause it was fun how it was originally supposed to.</data>

  <data key="d1">i had to travel a while back before vaccines were widely available and the best thing you can do for your anxiety is to over prepare. bring masks maybe a back up one too just bc, water, multiple hand sanitisers etc something to help with stress i.e. headphones so you can ignore everyone easier lol. try to work out where youre sitting on the plane see if itd be possible to move seats in a worst case scenario. also make sure you know how youre travelling to and from the airport like if someones picking you up maybe sit further away from them in the car if youre worried about passing on anything from the flight. as you all have vaccines itll most likely go fine. my friend flew recently someone on the flight found out they had covid. he isolated took several tests and they were all negative. try to remember you will get off the flight it wont last forever then you can feel safe with your family !</data>

  <data key="d1">my depression and anxiety ebbs and flows. presently, i have more crappy stressful days than good days, because my team at work is uncooperative and im getting ready to more on saturday. during disorganized unstable times when im forced to break from my established routines, my depression and anxiety tend to worsen. but this too shall pass. next year, when i think back on this time, ill be able to remember that it was stressful, but it will no longer stress me out.</data>

  <data key="d1">what are two good things that happened today? things you're grateful for, people you care about, something that made you laugh, something nice you did or that someone did for you, something that made you feel hopeful, etc. what's one thing you're looking forward to? it can be super simple, like eating a poptart, if that's what you're into. this is kind of a cousin of positive thinking, if you repeat this regularly it will become more of a habit and you'll train yourself to notice more positive things. i'm nearly double your age and still learning to do it but when i do it, it always helps. you are making progress even if it doesn't feel like it. you have grown in some way from last year, even if it feels like you took a few steps backward in 50 other aspects of your life. there's a lot of good out there, and our brains make it difficult to see sometimes. editing to add i want to be clear, my message isn't to just feel better this is something you have to actively practice and it will take time. it's not pure willpower, either it's giving yourself permission to see the light in the dark, to grab onto the life raft in all the numbness they're small, but they're there. it doesn't matter what you pick, it just matters that you pick something despite your brain telling you everything is scary and sucks. i say this as someone who still doesn't exercise, doesn't meditate half as much as she recommends it, who has been on and off meds, and has been in therapy for a decade you have a ton of power, way more than it feels like sometimes. please don't give any more of it to your anxiety than slips away on its own.</data>

  <data key="d1">i would sit her down and tell her exactly what you just said. mom, we need to talk about this. i know you think it's funny, but to me it isn't anymore. a joke is a joke when all people can laugh about it. if just one person is laughing and one is scared, it's not a joke anymore. i know you don't mean to hurt me but you have to realize that this is a boundary that can not be crossed at the moment. i can't feel safe around you when you don't care about my boundaries and don't want to have to stop visiting because of that. so please respect that and all will be fine.</data>

  <data key="d1">thanks! i needed to hear that. yeah, i have had this from time to time but never for days. but i also feel that what you said is correct. i have a lot on my plate now and most likely i am also unconsciously just on overdrive like you said. i will keep following my routines, meditating etc and try to not pay too much attention to the background music probably acceptance here is also the way forward.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'd go to a doctor or a dentist to make sure. maybe it's something that easy to fix. are you sure you're not sensitive or allergic to any of the chemicals in your toothpaste? perhaps you could try brushing without toothpaste a couple times your mouth will still get clean, followed by thoroughly rinsing your mouth with saltwater. that way, you could at least see if it's the toothpaste that's contributing to the problem. if it is, maybe switch to a different toothpaste? does you spend a lot of time alone? i used to, and sometimes after a couple weeks, i would try to talk to someone, and i would be surprised as my thrat was so hoarse from not speaking for so long. it sounds like a frustrating problem, but maybe there's an easy solution. edit also, if you're getting lightheaded brushing your teeth, is it nasal congestion that's causing that?</data>

  <data key="d1">i gone to xray my lungs and for blood test, all didn't showed something serious. i think i will go to allergy and nose and throat doctor too soon enough. i had this issue come and go for a lot time, just now recently didnt cared so much about it, but when it seemes i overcome my anxiety completely , this thing showed up out of nowhere and now i am suffering from it for straight 3 weeks. for 3 weeks i feel very good and want to go out with someone and talk and then irritating throat hit me and prevent me from doing it. like in my mind i feel i can talk freely , calmly, but this hoarse throat full of mucus prevent me from doing that cause it is difficult to talk and it frustrated a lot for me for these past 3 weeks. like you are not anxious at all, you are calm and very confident and this shit prevents you from doing anything. even if it is not just in my mind, is there some way to somehow ignore it and be active. i see as i get worse well less sleep and angry, like right know it is not that noticeable than when i am in normal state. i have wasted full 3 weeks on this shit, and can't deal with it. and waste my time now too. i cant deal with it. it may be small deal but it is very exhausting when you cant communicate like a normal person. i tried whole free weeks to fix it , as found hope everytime, but now i think i reached a final top when its other, and i dont know what to do. i just wanted to enjoy at least a month of summer vacation before heading back to university and now everything is over. i done everything right, everything that i needed and still some shit comes up that i cannot fix and ignore. it so frustrates me i just can't deal with it. i accomplished so much and because of this shit all goes in vain for nothing as i waste my time. if i knew it is a placebo effect i would already fixed it , but i am not sure now, when this shit pops up randomly from time to time. i just don't know what to do. maybe its both placebo and a real thing. well it is a real thing but i make it more irritating. i drank ginger tea for the past couple of days and sucked some candy like medication and maybe it helped a little but it still pops up somehow sometime. just when i think about talking i immediatly get that hoarsiness and mucus, well right now it is less effeftive as i said i am now in not that relaxed state. i didnt even exercised and runned , because i thought that would make my throat worse, cause in that day that happened i were running, and running does worsen it, but i still runned because it helped me with my anxiety symptoms and body aches from it a lot, and you just feel very good then. and i feel that irritate throat right know when i think about running so maybe that could be the factor as well, although you could say i dis start running just recently this year , and i do not run everyday, just sometimes well i done cycling a lot instead by delivering food. i just feel like when i turn on my brain to be hyperactive i get this symptom now somehow even if i don't feel anxious at all. its like somehow my brain now wired being hyperactive with feeling sore , stuck of mucus hoarse throat, so because of that i now in the past days tried to think about something else instead to put my mind of it i read a lot about these subjects like free will, determinism, suicide and how to fix throat that i now want to vomit from it . and cant punnish myself that i waste my time, because then it would make things even worse, but i cant fix them too so i am stuck in here doing nothing all day, because of my throat. i fixed a lot of things, thought that all things, and then bam! this insident. i know i seems that i am just making a big deal of it, but it really affected me. like a chain of reaction. and when it happened i knew it would be a chain of reaction if i didn't fix it, so i tried but still same shit. like shit man, give me normal problam, that you know , a normal human has, anything that can be fixed, but not this. i wish i got normal problems, not this throat shit, which i could now fix not that hardly, cause i dont care shit about a lot of things friends, partners etc. , i am better without much commitement, i fixed it all. but i cant fix this . its like there stuck, and because of it i cant communicate freely, therefore i cant go out with certain people because of it i again couldn't speak anymore and fuck it even more well its just basic science, if you couldn't talk all the time normally when you meet, then you learn it and it becomes to talk even harder next time, just neuroscience, and i understand that, i understand a lot of things, but that does not mean i can fix it l. you would say i just needed to accept it and let it be what it is right ? well even that is wrong, because viewing from past perspective i did this acceptance to almost a lot of things which could be fixable, and now i suffer the consequences. one small example would be that sometimes i used to feel lightheaded and sleepy after hot shower. and it made a lot of things worse because of it well it was more difficult to talk with people,because of the like high feeling . and i felt like i was just paying to much attention to it. but now that i tried cold shower for the past few month, everything changed. i was more energetic, focused, and not sleepy at all. so, in the past if i would not have accepted it, i could have fixed it sooner. and my thought about this toothpaste and throat problems arouse in similar way. why i have to accept it if maybe i could just fix it all together somehow and never have to worry about it at all in the future. so that's because i tried to fix it and look for all possible solutions and do everything to prevent it. but failed. although in the time i understood it is more logical to try one option example to brush with different or no toothpaste for several days and see what happens and until then forget about the issue but i needed to fix this soon for my reasons so that's why i failed all together. it just frustrates me of how much i come how much i accomplished for some small seeming meaningfully thing to affect my life in such a way. i tried to do some other activities , but it still haunted me in some way. and as i said, i even think this is not placebo, that this is true, just thinking about it makes it worse. i am just so frustrated of everything. how can i have free will if those things exist. how can i be responsible for this as i tried everything. sorry for so long essay, i just needed to vent out. i am just very much frustrated. now by reading it, maybe you think this is somehow nocebo related and can be fixed ? i am now given up of trying to fix it by an old anxiety ways, so i am now trying to shift my focus to something else and then try again, but i doubt it will work. i don't have much option until this month 25 day, cause i have another visit at family doctor about this issue. it just frustrates how much time i waste because of it. if not this, i would enjoyed my 3 weeks so much , but i couldn't. i would maybe compare it to this how to feel good and confident if you dress badly ? like maybe it is possible, but you know it is almost impossible. to feel good you need to bettern outside things, not feeling. i always thought that nothing like this matter and its just everything in our minds as a kind of bullshit a lot of people tell, when they themselves dress good, look out for their body etc., but then understood that even when it may be true to some degree, it is mostly bullshit. fix outside factors, and inside factor will fix too i gain weight, exercised, got better clothes, got away from parents house and finally had privacy in the past i lived with my brother in same room, and there were almost no peace, always noses from everywhere, i was just going of my mind and then as you dress nice, you act nice. its all important. as is ability to talk freely, which somehow was taken from me by that stupid incident, and i couldn't fix it. so because of it i am stuck in now. when i want to do something interesting go out with friends or family i feel good for a while and then get that stupid feeling in my throat which prevents me from going out , because even if you want it, you know it will not be good cause you cannot talk. how much time i wasted of this, oh how much. i think i am going to puke seriously. how much hope i got and then do nothing because of it still affected me. and now it is even more difficult to do something, because of wasted 3 weeks. it seems when things like this happen i can only go downwards to then feel worse things than that, and just then keep up. why i can't go up in the same good place. why i always need to go down to want to go up to the same place and the sameness repeats.</data>

  <data key="d1">get the second dose, if you are worried about your health then the risk from covid is far greater than the risk from the vaccine. it will be tough for a few weeks but by getting it you are protecting yourself the best you can. anecdotal and self reported evidence is notoriously unreliable and thats what those posts are. yes there are some incredibly rare side effects like heart inflammation but they really are an astonishingly small risk. i had my second dose of pfizer a few weeks ago and the worst i had was about 45 days of muscle weakness.</data>

  <data key="d1">you create so much anxiety in your body by searching for posts on vaccine's side effects. you don't even know if those stories are accurate or if there's more to them than what they say. only rely on what your friendsfamily have experienced after the shot. also, because the internet is such a crazy space right now, doing a detox might help.reading, being outside in nature, practicing a hobby..all this is much better than being on social media and checking vaccinerelated stories. i actually thought of deleting my reddit account because every single day i get a notification of someone talking about the vaccine... also, do you practice mindfulness or meditation? it really helps with the anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">you can't think you're way out of this. anxiety doesn't run on information. it runs on possibility and fear. read a bunch about covid literally killing people at 100,000 the frequency of vaccine complications beyond flu like symptoms for a day or two. in fact moderna found only a slight difference between vaccine and placebo groups in clinical trials. most of the side effects are actually projected or created by the individual, not inherent to the vaccine. so read a bunch more any people dying alone in a hospital after infecting their parents and killing them too. try to give anxiety that to chew on. keep reminding yourself that anxiety wants you to control things that seem like they are within your control, to give you a sense of predictability to the world. yeah you'll need to force yourself through this but there really isn't an external danger to it. don't buy the thoughts even if you have the thoughts and feelings.</data>

  <data key="d1">would you say sleep apnea is the source of the anxiety? broadly speaking people don't usually die from sleep apnea especially young people. when the airway narrows or collapses during sleep what happens is now there is more resistance, to keep breathing the same amount of airflow it now requires more force because of the increased resistance, and so naturally there is less airflow because during deep sleep the body isn't able to detect that more force is now required, or that the airway has narrowed or collapsed. once there is a desaturation or the body detects it isn't getting enough oxygen an emergency signal is sent to the brain to bring it out of deep sleep and either moves to a lighter stage of sleep or wakes you entirely especially in the case of a complete collapse. once this happens the brain is able to tell the body to breath harder and thus properly again. this means the body is very good at preventing permanent damage or even death, but the negative side effect is that you now need to wake up without ever really sleeping properly, and thus horrible daytime symptoms. i hope this helps you understand the problem is more to do with daytime symptoms than permanent brain damage or death. what are you currently doing to try and treat this disorder? do you need any help?</data>

  <data key="d1">everybody's struggle is bad for them, don't worry about downplaying your own struggles. for me taking my focus off labels i've been given, like learning disabilities helped me a bunch, went through life with many of them, but there's nothing wrong with me, i just need help sometimes, which everyone does. take some nice full breaths. i have struggled personally with not working, and wanting to help support financially, but as a stay at home parent, i had to accept the fact that since i don't absolutely need to do it, that focusing on my health was much more important for me, and everyone else around me, so i can start being there for them better. in my opinion if you don't have good health, you risk not having much of anything at all. so if the working aspect is stressing you out and taking away your health, maybe focusing on school til that's done is a better option currently, while you can get in better health after. it's great that you understand your mom is trying your best even if she doesn't understand your anxiety, that helped me as well. follow your heart, it's the best guide, the mind can easily confuse you, and make things an over complicated mess, i know this from experience. i hope maybe this helps. wishing you well.</data>

  <data key="d1">health first, friend! if youre not healthy or feeling well, its very difficult to focus on things like tackling anxiety or figuring out what to do about a job. pick one goal and focus on it if you can. i would make getting the surgery your goal and work toward that. which, after reading the comments it sounds like you are doing. i understand getting anxiety while waiting as a lot of my anxiety is also anticipatory. take it easy, focus on school and rest lots. for the sweating and stuff, im on a very low dose of a beta blocker for other health reasons but my cardiologist told me he takes a little for physical symptoms of his anxiety. being on one has definitely helped me control my physical symptoms like shaking, sweating, etc.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm going through the same stuff now. anxiety can present itself in a variety of ways and that's just something that can happen. when you feel anxious, your body goes into fightorflight mode because of a perceived threat. your body will release adrenaline, which may make you feel tingly at your hands and feet when anxious. your body may also make your joints tense, causing the aches and soreness. it's not the best explanation, but i hope it can somewhat put you at ease. just know that you're not alone.</data>

  <data key="d1">i 35, m am on sertraline since end of march this year. i started with half a tablet as instructed by my psychiatrist to somehow prep my body. on the fourth day, i started taking one tablet per day. i am not sure if it was because of sertraline but on the night i started that one tablet, my blood pressure shot up to unimaginable levels that i was not able to sleep the whole night up to the morning of the next day. note i am hypertensive and i have maintenance meds. i had to see a cardiologist the following day and she gave me a new drug for high blood pressure. when i saw him after two weeks, the psychiatrist assured me that sertraline is safe but i decided to return to taking half a tablet just to get the benefits albeit gradually. i must say that taking sertraline made me less prone to anger although that's not what i wanted to manage.</data>

  <data key="d1">mental health medication isn't a perfect science, but it can really help. i've been on setraline for 2 years now. i started at 50mg and it worked really well for about 6 months. then i went up to 75mg because it wasn't working super well after a while. but then 75mg was actually quite numbing for me and i didn't like it. then i went back down to 50mg and added wellbutrin and it's such a good mix and very helpful for me now. it's been about a year and i'm still happy i'm on setraline and wellbutrine.</data>

  <data key="d1">when i first started taking it 50mg i had a tough time adjusting to it! the first few weeks i found myself having the worst anxiety of my life. id wake up shaking and sweating and my heart felt like it was going to beat out my chest. my head burned and i had awful thoughts. now ive been on it for 5 months, and im up to 200mg. it takes a bit of time to get adjusted but i read reviews on it of people having the same side effects but not everyone. that made me feel better so i kept going . now i feel much better, i still have some anxiety here and there especially after a social event. but its much better than it was before, so it has helped me and im going to keep myself on it! trust your body, youll know if its helping you, if not theres plenty of other medications you can try.</data>

  <data key="d1">talking with any health care provider even your primary care is most important here. there are two main questions you can ask yourself before setting an appointment do you experience anxiety, and does it have a noticeable impact on your life? in any way. anxiety will manifest itself differently in different people. my anxiety causes me to shut down or freeze. my husband manifests his anxiety by over planning he will go through all the potential what if scenarios. there are also tons of anxiety disorders which may post in here. specific phobias and sure, gad, may lead to panic attacks, but not all clinically significant anxiety will come with panic attacks. also, panic disorder is its own disorder its not gad. some people have just panic disorder! agoraphobia is a specific phobia and it is not needed to have gad. the thing with gad is that you dont need to have any specific situation that triggers the anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">anxiety is tied to interoception your perception within your body that something is wrong like fast heartrate or your inability to perceive that it is alright. mindfulness is a great way to ride the waves of bodily sensations, but i find that guided physical exercise, where i'm told what to do, helps me to regulate interoception. i use aikido or gym hiit classes to go to the root of the physical sensations and reduce them, though any vigorous physical exercise will help.</data>

  <data key="d1">my intentions this week are to just take things one day at a time. i have appointments just about every day this week plus my todo list is a mile long. i could easily get overwhelmed. as far as appointments go, i have to meet with my dog's potential new pet sitter on tuesday evening, i have to take my dog to the groomer on wednesday afternoon for a nail trim, i have a dentist appointment on thursday afternoon, i have something on friday but i can't remember what exactly, i have to help my mom with a craft fair she sells jewelry on saturday and sunday. i'm also in the middle of remodeling my kitchen, organizing my office looks like a storage room, swapping out summer clothes for fall clothes in my master closet, doing a few last yard tasks before it gets too cold out, replacing the weatherstripping on my front door, updating my online shop for the christmas shopping season and then there's the basic cleaning tasks that i need to do every week to not turn into a slob. right now, i'm just going to focus on monday and not even think about the other days of the week so i don't get too overwhelmed and anxious. i have no appointments on monday so i'm going to focus on stuff i can do from home add a coat of drywall mud to the tape joints in my kitchen, update one section of my website, mow the lawn, organize one box of stuff in my office and take a shower. i think i can handle those 5 relatively easy tasks. if i just focus on one day at a time this week, i think i can come out of it less anxious andor stressed.</data>

  <data key="d1">this is heartbreaking, im so sorry for your wife. i can completely understand she is too terrified to hope that it will all turn out well. i think couples counseling is a great idea and i also think your wife needs to go to counseling on her own she needs to be able to talk about the losses and her deep terror of another one to someone professional. youre loving and supportive and kind, which is very good i just think her trauma level is above what can be helped by a partners love. youre doing your best, and shes lucky to have you. she needs a professional, who can deal with ptsd and loss and miscarriages. best of luck to both of you, i hope that both babies are born healthy and happy and you finally get to have the family you want.</data>

  <data key="d1">i would definitely recommend looking for professional help. it seems like her anxieties are due to compounded reasons, and will take a bit of work to clear up. it's not a quick process, but speaking from someone who has a therapist, and is passionate about advocating for mental health wellbeing as a couple you might gain some insight into how and why your partner is feeling this way. as for what you can do, this might sound weird, but try giving your partner space. when i'm in the shithole, i would prefer if people just left me alone, and let me come out of my shell when i'm ready. my advice would be to make your availability to support her known, but refrain from forcingcoercing her to do anything she might not want to be doing. sometimes time is the best solution.</data>

  <data key="d1">there should be some positive results soon from the new sleeping pills ... the step down to part time work. and i agree with the other commenter that a therapist specializing in ptsd is probably needed as well you need to take care of yourself too get exercise and maybe take breaks from your partner if her anxiety is overwhelming. nami has support groups for loved ones of the mentally ill might be on zoom right now. google nami near me and see what they're doing where you live</data>

  <data key="d1">the first response you received here was very atypical of this subreddit. please don't take it as a reflection of the userbase. this is a supportive place. couples therapy is a good start, but if she's not in individual therapy, you should look into that. it seems to me like this isn't principally a relationship issue, but rather her own issues driving the conflicts. this isn't to dismiss the value of couples therapy i suspect that by going together, you will learn the ways in which your attempts to be supportive are not helping her, and you can start modifying your approach from a place of knowledge and understanding. you will also get a chance to discuss how to express your feelings about your respective pregnancies in a way that doesn't put stress on the other spouse. it's not good for you to feel stifled, and it's not good for her to be triggered, and in both cases, it's not good for the pregnancy. you say that she always reacts with anxiety and dread. if the problem goes away once she has what she wanted, then you might just have to tough it out and again, individual therapy is helpful and let her feel her feelings until they go away, either naturally dissipating with time or because she uses anxiety reducing techniques effectively. one thing that i notice you bring up is that to support her, you ask her to do things with you. when my partner had anxiety, sometimes the best thing to do was to do something nice for him, allowing him to direct his energy toward fighting the anxiety rather than toward going out into a different environment than the one he was most comfortable in. she says she is going to be jealous if her baby dies and mine survives and she's worried she won't love my baby. this is the biggest red flag. you should have a plan for these outcomes. this should be done at least partly with the couples therapist. but there's a real chance that these things can happen, and there's no reason to wait until they do to imagine a course of action. you can support her by saying that you understand why she has these feelings, and that you want to make sure that you both are prepared for all possibilities, including the good ones too! good luck with both pregnancies, and i hope your twinesque children bring you both the joy that babies so often deliver.</data>

  <data key="d1">im sorry you are going through this. yikes both partners are pregnant. that alone is crazy stressful. like hormone battle royale. i suppose just understand she has a very reasonable reason to be anxious. keep supporting her with understanding. as for the toxic things she is saying that could be just the anxietydepression talking. she may very well become very depressed if the baby miscarries again and resent you and the baby for some time. sounds like your partner has pretty severe mental health problems and will likely have those throughout your relationship. its really up to her to take the necessary steps to get well which is way beyond taking pills. medication is like a bandaid. it helps but it doesnt do the healing. the individual does the healing. therapy, meditation, time in nature, grounding techniques, cutting out alcohol and caffeine etc. it takes a lot of fing work to beat this disease and it takes a lifetime of self work to keep it in check.</data>

  <data key="d1">at first i thought maybe you two have different love language thats why its hard to communicate, but the more i read im pretty certain shes under stress. going to therapy is a good start, but i would also say trying to communicate to your wife on a emotional level. when i was stressed out, ex bf would take me out but that didnt work too well. all i want is emotional connection like understanding my sadness because i value empathy more than material things, trying to figure out this gap between you and knowing whats important to your wife definitely helps. but if you feel drained, definitely consider taking yourself care first too!</data>

  <data key="d1">i think first and foremost she needs a therapist, hopefully one that has experience working with women who have suffered pregnancy loss andor infertility andor complicated pregnancies. the second thing she can do is get different medication. you say she's on pregnancy safe medications now, but don't say what those are. even though doctors have preferred medications and classes of medications to use on pregnant women, if they are not working other options that are less safe can be tried. if a pregnant woman is in the level of constant extreme stress you describe, that also can be harmful to both mom and the pregnancy. the risks of different medication will almost certainly be outweighed by the potential benefits. x200b corollary she should not be expected to gut it out and do without for the sake of the pregnancy. that is a harmful and toxic mindset. anyone who suggests this should be given a tongue lashing the likes of which they've never had before. x200b how you can support her remember that she is going through something that is deeply traumatic for her. i guarantee you that she does not want to react how she's reacting. she may not have thought she would have reacted in this way to another pregnancy, but she did. responses to trauma cannot always be predicted. recognize that this is a problem that is bigger than you or your relationship. she's going to need a lot of handholding and support, and a lot of that is going to need to come from professionals. both because you are not equipped to fully handle it, and also because its unfair to you to expect you to shoulder that burden entirely. on your end, i'd encourage you to get your own therapist, so you can work out ideas about how to enjoy your pregnancy because you have a right to do that while also being mindful about her mental state. also a therapist can give you that ear and sounding board that you need, but your partner can't necessarily provide right now. a couples therapist is also probably a good idea. i dont know what kind of difficult discussions need to be had, but you are probably going to have to have some difficult discussions with your partner. a couples therapist can serve as kind of a mediator for both of you, letting you both express yourselves while also keeping the temperature of things tolerable. what i worry about happening is that you try to have a discussion with your partner without some kind a mediator and one or both of you gets triggered, and that discussion goes irretrievably south. the circumstance you both are in right now is really just a very delicate situation, and the therapist would serve the function of helping you both communicate in the least distressing way possible. edit another thing to keep in mind is that anxiety, when you are in the thick of it, is very difficult or even impossible to rationalize with. the anxiety isnt necessarily a phobia, but kind of works in the same way. the way therapy works is to talk through the anxietyprovoking things in a controlled environment before a person gets to the point where they cannot be rational. you learn to tolerate a certain level of emotional stress, until through repeat experience you build a bit of tolerance. youre actively retraining your brain.</data>

  <data key="d1">i agree with everyone who says she needs to go to therapy. she definitely has some trauma related to the past few pregnancies and needs to work through it. while i see her side, it is totally unfair to you to not get to be excited about your pregnancy or do baby related things in front of her. you should definitely bring that up in y'alls therapy together, because it isn't her baby and your baby they are both your kids and you are both their mom's. blood doesn't make a kid your kid. it's knowing that you would do anything for that kid and then proving it. people who adopt are very much parents to their children even if they came from someone else's genes. it's a feeling of overwhelming love not a blood bond. as far as coping with her if she has anxiety so bad she needs medication to get it under control, you will never be able to reason with her. her brain is lying to her and giving her 20 different worst case scenarios to any reasonable thing you say to her. ask her if there is anything you can do to ease her anxiety when you see she is anxious about something. maybe there is, maybe there isn't. sometimes for me, i have something that will make me feel better, and sometimes there isn't anything. just be patient with her. she is frustrated and exhausted with herself enough, she doesn't need someone else to rub it in by getting annoyed or frustrated with her. maybe do little things as surprises for her like doing something she normally does around the house. or plan a date and take control of everything so she doesn't have to think about it. whatever you can do to lower her stress level is going to be good, and it will be good for the baby. that much stress and cortisol release can't be healthy for the baby. you can't say this directly to anyone who has anxiety, but just know that she needs to calm down. anything you can do to help her do that, is what you should be doing. also, women have been indoctrinated for years that our worth is based on us being incubators and birthers. apparently to some, you aren't a real woman if you don't give birth to your own baby. she is probably feeling like a massive failure as a woman because she has had 3 pregnancies resulting in no live births. she probably blames herself for the miscarriages and possibly even for the 3rd's defects. this is very common for women because we are put here on this earth to do one thing and she hasn't done it yet. this is the stupidest comparison if you ask me. i was not put on the earth to just pop out kids. i was put here because my parents popped people out, and now i am just trying to figure out what i like to do for the rest of my life. halsey said something to this effect about her miscarriage before her baby was born, and it really upset me because she seemed to be very progressive in her views. just because you have a uterus doesn't mean 1 it will work 2 it has to work and 3 you are a failure if it doesn't. my uterus will never house a child, but i am 100 still a female that bleeds from my uterus every month because i didn't make a baby. i am still 100 female even if i didn't bleed every month. i am still full of worth and still worthy of life as a female even though my special lady parts will not be creating the thing they were intended to create. i am not my uterus, i am a human being. she's probably struggling with this the most.</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel for you. youre pregnant for your first time and you cant even talk about it or express feelings about much of anything surrounding either of your pregnancies. she might need her own trauma therapy, in addition to the couples therapy. hopefully, if you end up with one or two babies itll change things for her. give her the purpose of parenting. a whole new exciting experience to worry about if thats what she does. if that makes sense. maybe let out your feelings here and there and not bottle it all up. if she doesnt know youre hurting or why then she cant possibly try to fix it. hopefully she can realize that your feelings are as important as hers. she can still hurt and be sad while letting you feel what you feel. i hope you end up with 2 healthy babies!</data>

  <data key="d1">congratulations on both your babies, but im sorry you cant celebrate yours the way youd like to. i agree with the other commenters, couples therapy is important, but i also think you should talk to a therapist to sort out your feelings. your partner is neglecting you, and shes denying you the right to feel happiness over something thats very important to you. a therapist will help you find a way to begin to set healthy boundaries within the dynamic of your relationship that allow you to function in a healthy space. your parent is not healthy or functional and your space isnt really emotionally safe for you. if shes having some kind of hormonal issue, she may be prone to ppd. this is a situation you need to get ahead of, and be prepared for very possibly needing to protect both babies if she becomes unstable. her comment about not being able to love your baby is very disturbing. please pay attention to that. i have severe anxiety from extreme trauma that came out of the death of my husband, and i struggle with it in a million ways, but i see a psychiatristpsychotherapist and i force myself to function on days id rather crawl under my covers and turn my phone off. i dont doubt your wife has anxiety, but i think theres something else at play above and beyond the anxiety. i wish you luck and a very happy and healthy pregnancy, and your wife as well, but please make sure and put you and your baby first. take care.</data>

  <data key="d1">first of all, i am so sorry for everything that has happened and huge congratulations. i have sort of a similar experience...i went through ivf twice and was finally successful. when we were successful, it was so anticlimactic because of all the years of trauma in our journey many other things happened. the bottom line is i sought out a therapist who specializes in anxiety in pregnancy and my husband and i joined a group with partners through my therapist that had similar journeys. it helped immensely. if you are in a major city, you will find these specialized therapists. if not, many of them are doing telehealth. i am so sorry your wife is going through this. i can completely relate. i missed out on the joy of pregnancy due to my anxiety and that sucks because i can't go back and change it. we have a beautiful prize at the end, but it took years to get there and many mental health challenges. i am up right now checking the monitor...it never goes away, but it does become manageable. have you gone to? i know that is doesn't exactly fit you experience, but there are many stories similar to your wife's relating to anxiety in pregnancy. i still get angry when i hear about people who have a perfect pregnancy i know that sounds insane, but the trauma has caused this experience. hugs to you both and sending love.</data>

  <data key="d1">unfortunately, no, theres not a ton you can do besides be supportive and try to be understanding. and its hard on our end to give you concrete ideas of what to do to accomplish that, because we dont know either of you, and everyone defines what they need to feel supported differently. what you could do is talk with your partner, at a time where she is calm, and ask her what you can do to help, both in a general sense and also when her anxiety is particularly bad. reassure her that you dont need that answer right now, and its ok if she doesnt have an answer. also ask her if there are any things that you do or say which are categorically unhelpful. some people want cuddled and held when theyre really anxious, and for other people thats the last thing on earth they want. you may think your tone of voice is soothing, but she may think its patronizing something that happens between me and my husband. just those things where no one is doing anything wrong, but they arent helping either. no ones fault, just is what it is.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi, i found your post by searching. ive had a mysterious cough with mild shortness of breath and a presence in my sternum, come and go a few times during the pandemic. its a mild and dry cough and often just a single sudden and shallow huh type of cough. every time it happens i get tested for covid, and its never been positive. i decided to get it checked out this week and had some tests done including chest xray and everything came back normal. it had occurred to me that it could be anxiety related because a things at work have been stressful lately and b i noticed that all symptoms stopped while i was having a nice phone convo this week, despite me talking a lot. anyway, i hope youre feeling better. getting other things ruled out has been helpful for my own anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">a big part of helping me change my thought patterns was forgiving myself for having the thoughts in the first place. a lot of the thought patterns that were damaging to my mental health were a double whammy of i hate myself and then i hate myself for hating myself. taking it easy on yourself is a big step towards loving yourself. also, if you find books helpful, i recommend unwinding anxiety by judson brewer. it looks at anxiety from the perspective of an addiction. its backed by a lot of science and case studies and really made a ton of the therapy click in my head. it felt like every chapter i read chipped a little more of my anxiety away. i still have the thoughts and im sure they are mostly likely here to stay, but they dont have the power they once did. remember you are not your thoughts. you are amazing whether you believe it right now or not. it gets better</data>

  <data key="d1">of course. with a little objectivity and a good attitude! find a support system if you can! i had to solo this shit because all i felt was shame when ever i tried to reach out for help. i had to read a lot, and got comfortable with being uncomfortable. the days i was like fuck it heart, do your worst was the days i gained the most strength. don't be like me though, if you can see a regular doctor, then do so. also, if you live in the states, paying medical bills is more of a suggestion... for the moment any ways.</data>

  <data key="d1">something that has always helped me when i feel myself going that way is to sit down and do some sudoku puzzles. i know not everybody is good at math or even with numbers, but i have always had a thing with numbers, and i think thats why it helps. deep down i know its a diversionary tactic, but if something works you gotta stick with it. id say crossword puzzles would work about the same way.</data>

  <data key="d1">did one side of your face get numb when it was at its worse? i had heightened visual and sound sensitivity. it always scares me cuz you think you feel blood swishing in there or something near the temple. i'm trying to prevent them, does your migraine side get tight at times. when inwas getting stressed last week. my migraine side near the temple had my skin tighten in that area. the opposite side seemed normal. it's so hard to explain to my family as none of them ever had migraines. and they probably just think it's a bad headache. it's does not feel like a headache to me.</data>

  <data key="d1">honestly, and i don't think you're going to like but it's my honest take... when you have these episodes it's amazing that these people rush to your aid, it makes you feel important and loved, like you're worth something, like people care. that's great, i get it. but you must be responsible with their emotions and care. it sounds like you already know what's going on. i think something amazing you could do is get a small treat they like, fooddrinkflowers and drop it round to them and say thank you for being a friend. you're very lucky to have people in your life who have got your back, that relationship needs nurturing, feeding. if it's only bad times even the best people can grow tired. make your next interaction with these people a positive one.</data>

  <data key="d1">absolutely, it doesn't need to be some big gesture, just something to show them you were thinking of them and you appreciate them. also try to see the value in yourself, you've obviously got a lot going for you or they wouldn't care. you don't need these big explosions to draw their attention, try to reach out before it gets too big to keep a lid on. it doesn't even need to be, 'things are getting bad i need to talk to you', keep it casual, the interaction alone will be a distraction from your thoughts. a little 'nudge' is always good, 'hey, just wondered how you got on with...' some event in their life. it keeps you tethered to each other so you don't feel you're floating out to sea on your own. no one wants a friendshiprelationship that's 100 all the time, need a little light to go with the shade</data>

  <data key="d1">tbh how i treat my anxiety is using essential oils and just putting them on this plate thing that heats it up. and then listen to asmr and then just lay down. and write about my day on my phone on a document about how i improved from the previous day. one time my pc got water into it i died inside, freaked out a lot, but got one fast asf, now i'm a dead beat if my pc broke i could give zero phuks but yuh. anxiety sucks ass, i get it. hope you do well.</data>

  <data key="d1">i noticed my anxiety becomes near uncontrollable when i eat too much sugar..the processed kind and coffee. for me drinking some energy drink to replenish electrolyes, with low to no sugar will help me. if you eat it is best to only eat carbs together with protein or fat. try to eat even a little since hunger will just make things worse..maybe some eggs and avocado. i hope your problems will resolve soon</data>

  <data key="d1">to some extent thoughts are intrusive, or worrying, if you let them be. in other circumstances those questions, well the first one a bit more than the second, are reasonable ones to ask and are maybe reflecting some insecurities you have. if you live in a tall building you may wonder how it stays up. you are a teenager and this is time in your life when your brain changes a lot, you become aware of more stuff but dont always have the knowledge or experience to rationalise it or deal with it. what do you know about reinforced concrete or civil engineering for example? and the human brain, being what is, can take you to weird places as it tries to process things. theres nothing wrong with asking weird questions or wondering why?, many inventions have come from a what if. id be more concerned if you were becoming obsessed and wouldnt go home because you were terrified the building would fall down, for example. gravity wont disappear, and if you do a bit of googling you can find out why. gravity depends on the mass of an object and for gravity to disappear the earth would have to disappear, and the sun, and everything else. so what you could do if you are getting thoughts like this is go and investigate. you may find stuff you cant understand, but youll hopefully be able put your mind at ease if you can find some background info that makes sense.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm in a similar situation with work, but everyone is different, so take my comments with a grain of salt. take care of yourself first, because if you don't, you can't be your best self at your job. it's taken me awhile to understand that. i'm a teacher, well, soon to be was. 90 of my anxiety stemmed from a toxic work environment. it's taken me a nervous breakdown and damn near a second one, to realize that my mental health is more important than my job, so i'm resigning and looking for a less intensive version of my job while i finish my school librarian certification which is what i really want to do in education. it's time for me to leave the regular classroom. you mentioned the power dynamics at your job being a factor. can you change to a different job in the same career field? only you can decide if that's the biggest factor and what to do about it. i recommend also seeing a therapist to talk through and process your sources of anxiety. understanding the underlying causes of your anxiety can help you make changes or approach things differently to lessen the anxiety. sending virtual hugs!</data>

  <data key="d1">i believe seeing a psychiatrist is a good option. a good psychiatrist who listens to your needs, gives you the time you need and freely talks about absolutely anything you bring up. that being said, i wanna share my experience with y'all. i started having panic attacks and anxiety, and at that time, i was going through the exact same thing. for one whole year, it did not appear to me that this was anxiety. i thought i had some other health issue. after spending two months having constant panic attacks and insomnia, i realised the issue. saw a psychiatrist and refused to take any medications. i was scared about the things i read online. medication is safe and effective you may have some issue adjusting to them initially, but things get better. a lot better once you continue. do not stop taking the meds and take them only as per instruction. speak to your doc, and tell them exactly what you said here. tell them nothing is working. you may also ask them directly about medications. if nothing is helping, switch your doc.</data>

  <data key="d1">sounds like anxiety. yes there's some problems with performance based on chronic and compulsive masterbation but 13xday isn't really out of the norm for someone your age. porn mostly sets up unrealistic sexual standards and can easily lead to sexual troubles due to personal feelings of failure eg. not lasting 45 minutes or partner disappointment thinking women actually like porn type sex and not knowing how to have real sex. looking for porn that depicts healthy, mutual, sexual satisfaction and not masturbating just because you are bored are both good ways to offset this. but mostly you're just anxious and it's found this as a reason. making the reasons legitimate and dealing with them isn't now you reduce anxiety, it's how you increase it.</data>

  <data key="d1">i didnt have anxiety as a child.. but have depression since i can remember.. my panic disorder came out of nowhere.. after my first panic attack it just was there.. as for my depression.. it formed, because i learned to early that life isnt fair and the world can be a cruel and shit place.. a place where the ones closest to you want to exploit and take advantage of you.. where the ones you call family will gladly take every opportunity to take the house you live in, just because they think they are the rightful owner inheritance disputes.. it made me truly bitter about the world and gave me serious trust issues.. which is still have to this day.. but i have them under control now.. i went from no hope and no point trying to the world is shit.. lets make the best of it.. everyday is a struggle.. but a worth it one why? because.. do you habe anything better to do? just live.. maybe something good may happen for once.. maybe not.. at least i could say in the end, that i tried. and no.. they dont say you are bright and smart to any kid.. i only did get punishments, when done something wrong.. a good was the highest praise you could get.. it is what it was.. im not trying to say i had it worse than you.. or some crap.. just answering your questions.. all suffering is valid in my book.. youre not dumb.. we are all dumb.. we are hairless apes, who think we now everything.. dont take values from others too seriously.. value yourself on only yourself..how did your old self change compared to now? where are you headed? comparing to others only leads to pain or arrogance.. especially on social media.. social media is a net negative for humanity and a cancer that needs to be destroyed and build up again for communication and learning.. not for oooh look at me im so unique and better than you all bullshit.. we are all unique by default.. it is our nature! how did my anxiety disorder change me? it forced me to quit hating myself.. and facing my worst fears.. which is.. difficult.. it got slowly better.. its not gone, but im now at a 110 to 310 lvl of anxiety daily.. sometimes none at all.. took loads of time and work.. but yeah.. sry for my rambling btw.. your post and question took a bit more to answer.. hope youre having a great day!</data>

  <data key="d1">there's a variant of ocd called scrupulosity. look it up. it's a guilt disorder. a guilt disorder is a condition in which there is not really guilt, but fear of endless punishment. genuine guilt is gentle, light on the mind as compared to panic and fear, and motivates you gently to change your behaviour. pathological guilt is just an extreme fear of being punished with no chance of escaping punishment. fear is supposed to be your best friend, the thing that saves your life from actual dangers, the thing that prevents you from walking into dens of lions, from picking up fights with mob bosses, and so on. but when the fear system combines with extreme imagination and untrue beliefs eternal constant afterlife it can go into a downward spiral when you imagine, then fear, then imagine worse, then fear more, then imagine even worse, then fear even more and so on till you basically freeze in panic and remain shell shocked and unable to think, process, move or function. you have to first realise that religion is only a set of beliefs, scientifically as good as lies, and essentially imaginary. you also have to read about where your belief came from. it is not widely known but religious historians know that early agnostic christians believed that jesus of nazareth preached that there is rebirth after death, not eternal afterlife. jesus preached some variant of what we now call buddhism peace, forgiveness, unconditional love towards everyone, being nonjudgemental, not hating even sinners, reforming people rather than punishing them, and so on. evil intelligent priests along the years in 2000 years of history distorted and manipulated the early healthy reasonable preachings of jesus into a sinbased, guiltmultiplying, fearmongering set of beliefs that make no sense. that is why scientists and rationalists and educated people refute religion, or even if they practise it, they only take the sensible parts and ignore the wild unreasonable parts. this book called life after life is written by a qualified modern doctor who conducted a study of neardeath experiences of people at the surgery table and there are patterns he observes that look similar to the beliefs of rebirth in parts. it's not science, it's unscientific, but it brings a lot of relief to see that many people have almost crossed over to the other side, come back and not really met a cruel judge waiting to punish them. instead they feel genuine calm and peace and a sense of oneness with the universe, a sense of extreme wellbeing, they see a loving light, and they meet a gentle friend, not an angry pissedoff judgemental idiot. nobody really knows what happens after death, and if someone were to come back from the dead, science would never believe it until they were able to kill and revive on demand, as is the requirement for all science currently. however, reading about other people's experiences when declared dead, or almost dead, in a coma and then coming back to narrate the whole experience, makes the burden much lighter by introducing an alternative set of facts to base your imagination on. so, please do read the book. there are some studies on consciousness going on and it appears that consciousness is not what it appears to be to mainstream science a mere product of the mind i think therefore i am. there are also questionable books and reports that describe experiences of people who claim to remember past lives and based on such beliefs there is a form of unscientific therapy called past life regression which is similar to exposure and response prevention facing your fears from past lives, not just the present one. i don't believe that is scientific, but that is out there too. stay in touch! notedisclaimer to any rationalists who might object since the crippling fear in question is about an afterlife, i am forced to deal with a topic that is not acknowledged as meaningful by mainstream science. hence this post. i am not peddling unscientific theories, i am merely providing a plausible alternative narrative for the frightened brain to escape its fears.</data>

  <data key="d1">someone in the roman empire studying the new pestilent irrepressible christian faith of yeshua decided that people back in 200300ad were not refraining from crime from fear of punishment because there was always rebirth. so they decided to make it more frightening by saying that if anyone committed crimes in this life, they would suffer forever. they basically maximised the threat to permanent status. then someone else, more cunning and manipulative realised that a strong threat would make people cower to power even more as long as it was repeated often enough. thus in the council of nicea in 325 ad, a lot of drastic changes were made to the preachings of yeshua and rome began the process of embracing and morphing christianity into something they could use as a tool of imperial expansion and power over the irrepressible followers of yeshua. this new distorted version worshipped the same name jesus but preached something completely different. basically they made a dirty mutation out of the original teachings of yeshua. a quick google gives this it should be reasonable to consider that the supposed resurrection was a demonstration of the ability of beings to persist outside a body and reincarnate at will. this guy is a m.d. and has come on tv. remember, none of this is science, all religious belief, so don't even attempt to apply the scientific method to it. the only conclusion you will come to is that this is junk. if you are rationalist, then death is very very peaceful it is exactly like the 14 billion years of the universe that passed before you were born pretty uneventful for you. so no punishment of any kind there. definitely none. source</data>

  <data key="d1">write out situationactionresult scenarios ahead of time. use the job description to pull themes from to cater your responses to. you can sometimes find interview questions for the company online, otherwise search for some for your field. it might also help actually talking through these for practice but not so much that you sound scripted and ingenuine. come up with questions for your interviewers. research the company. all of your responses should be positive, not negative and not based on conflict. don't talk down on your current employer or any colleagues. reframe negatives into positives i.e. i'm looking for a new opportunity to expand my skillset and learn. relax and be yourself. there are no wrong answers, and especially in this market, you are interviewing them just as much. a good pump up song before always helps!</data>

  <data key="d1">the stomach issues are very very common with anxiety id say nearly everyone that deals with anxietydepression has some sort of gi issues. personally ive had the serious stomach pains like you described above its gotten so bad sometimes im even afraid to eat. just take it one day at a time the physical symptoms are tough but it all starts in your head with your mental health. work on yourself and take small steps and in good time those feelings will start to fade</data>

  <data key="d1">well, its not physical pain per say, its emotional pain. i know emotional pain is physical to an extent, since emotions are the state of your mind reflected in your body, but what i mean is that its not pain in the same sense as say an ulcer. its pain like you might feel when youre about to cry. as a side note, however, i have had problems with occasional rectal bleeding for years. i dont know if thats a problem that anxious people commonly have, but i thought id mention it since you brought up digestion.</data>

  <data key="d1">there is not much you can do. most of us with anxiety have control issues and things we can't control bother us. start small understand that there is things you can't control and are out of your control and if things go bad you'll deal with it when it happens and not now.</data>

  <data key="d1">it sounds like you might be dissociating. it tends to happen when your feelings are too overwhelming ex anxiety followed by intrusive thoughts, panic and your brain kind of disconnects from reality. it thinks it's protecting you from the overwhelming situation. i get this all the time. it is super uncomfortable and can be scary. but it can't hurt you. look up grounding techniques. they help when you feel some intense anxiety coming on. they basically keep you in the present, not letting your mind go to that disconnect. they do take practice. it's not an instant fix. but the more you practice, the more you'll be able to keep yourself in the present.</data>

  <data key="d1">i can also relate to that. when anxiety levels are high it totally messes with our memory. it's a common symptom that's not really talked about. which can be scary when you have those intrusive thoughts. intrusive thoughts make us feel like we're going to act on them, when in reality we aren't. those aren't our real intentional thoughts. they're automatic thoughts produced by anxiety. you aren't choosing to think them. so a big step in dealing with them is understanding that they aren't you. you are not those thoughts. as horrible as they can be, try and recognize them for what they are and let them be. if you dwell on them and obsess over them they tend to stick around longer. once you really realize that it's just the anxiety, they'll become less frequent.</data>

  <data key="d1">i can relate a little to the pain youre experiencing i feel like i have been in a permanent panic attack for the last 6 months. ive never felt mindfulness or any of the normally suggested things work, however taking a shower is the one place ive felt a calming effect. maybe it is a mindfulness kind of exercise because my body and senses are all focussed on the feeling, sound and smell of the water. that said, ive also spent showers sitting on the floor because it wasnt enough to calm me, but its worth a try.</data>

  <data key="d1">where do i start? i went through that for over 20 years. how can i make this short. first of all, leave the diagnosing to a doctor. i had heart fears from 1986 through, i guess 1999. by then, it has tapered off to it happening once in a blue moon, but i had a few bouts clear up until 2013. the mistake i made was to see this as a medical issue. that suggestion that i was making to myself was precisely what was causing it. not my childhood, not my life anxiety in other issues. it all started with a bad reaction to alcoholcold remedy combination. from there on, i obsessed. i made dozens of trips to the er. i had arrhythmias of every imaginable kind and im still here at 64. the only time i get symptoms with only slight jitters is when i remember this. you just cant give this false alarm youre tripping any legitimacy. worrying about it, researching about it does no good. asking people who are still struggling with this does no good. gradually drop the sense of urgency. let go. accept the symptoms. remember, youve been through this many times and you come out fine. dont look at this negatively as hard as this is. beating this isnt about lowering your anxiety levels so you dont have symptoms, its about being okay with your symptoms as a means to them gradually going away. few people listen to me on the forums which is bizarre. i guess its because they dont like the idea of accepting symptoms, they just want them to go away. well, its precisely your wanting them to go away so badly what is causing them to begin with. do yourself a favor, check out these people. sign up with them. nope. i can never make this short.</data>

  <data key="d1">its not easy, but its the only way. you can start by not telling yourself you are dying or that you feel like you are dying. do doctors tell you that? then quit telling yourself lies. excuse me if i sound unsympathetic, believe me i am not. this is what i mean by accepting it. the correct word is resignation, but im not sure if youre familiar with the term. you dont have to like it, no one does, you just let it happen and decide to do nothing. you have to pull yourself out of this by facing it and changing your opinion about what it means, if not when its happening, at least the rest of the time. your general opinion of what this is what determines whether later on youll get an attack. no pill will do it for you, no psychotherapy and you do have control.though not when its happening. you control it when its not happening by what you tell yourself. after its over, dust yourself off and move on. expect the next time with the idea you will be better able to cope with it. have you ever had an attack and you question yourself how bad it was. you say, oh that was a bad one. but you kind of question whether it really was. you can change how you view it afterward. all they are is symptoms. you can handle it. you can also handle the fear and bring it down a notch every time. you need to drop this notion that you might get that big one. you might not accept it when its happening but you certainly can accept it when its over and you see that once again, false alarm, nothing happened. take it from me, a 20 plus year veteran of trying to scare myself to death not on purpose of course who abandoned his car in traffic.that it doesnt work to struggle with it. nothing is going to make it go away as long as this is a problem to you, this is what i mean by accepting it. the problem with most people who have this is that no matter what you tell them, its just not going to work. or easier said than done. whether you believe you can or that you cant, you are right. when you get an attack, just go oh well here we go again and dont do anything about it. leave it alone. of course you dont want to do that. nobody does. you want something to just make the symptoms to go away. but you dont make them go away. as long as you are focused on them, and they are a problem to you, they are going to be there. youre the one pressing the play button on that recording in your brain. you dont make them go away. there is no such animal because what is causing it is your distress about it. you let the symptoms go away by not resisting. let yourself get distracted naturally. let it drift away on its own with no interference from you. since this is cardiovascular, when its happening, take a deep deep breath hold it about 10 seconds then let it out very slowly. you might feel a little dizzy but this will pass quickly. afterward, so often, empty out your lungs. i see a lot of frantic worry in what you write. ive been there, its awful. but you need to change how you look at this. the more you say negative things, the more you dig yourself in. you think saying something positive is lying to yourself? how do you think this whole thing started to begin with? they werent deliberate lies, but it was misinformation or should i say misinterpretation. this is big always ask yourself, what happened last time?nothing. the time before that? nothing. the last few dozens or hundreds of times? nothing. so ask yourself what do you truly believe, believe not fear will happen. nothing of course. so if you take that attitude every time, guess what will happen over the next few weeks or months and you stop obsessing? itll be gone! most people dont get over it soon but only because like a scab that needs to heal, they keep picking it off. the minute the symptoms come back there back with they started saying it didnt work, thinking that shows theyre scared and not convinced. you are convinced. by now, its not that you truly believe something will happen. it has become fear of fear. you need to learn not to be afraid. its like an upside down roller coaster, you know damn well youre not going to come crashing down to the earth, but i for one an sure as hell not going on. you need to take baby steps and get desensitized gradually and dump the negative talk. and no your case is not different. i have talked to hundreds of people and pulled out 32.</data>

  <data key="d1">you said it, you have severe health anxiety. so which is it? is it health anxiety or actual health problems. its like deep down you know its not real but you tell yourself it is. in psychology its known as a catastrophic fantasy. not that your symptoms arent real mind you. but they are a false alarm. youre trying to ride both sides of the street the way i did. you know its anxiety your own suggestion but youre looking for a physical cause. endeavoring to make it more real and tangible every time to root it out. this is a product of your own self talk. the power of suggestion is enormous. the way to know if something is real is you tell yourself youre going to leave it alone and wait for your body to let you know if theres a problem. if you see that it went away then you know its your own what if thoughts. nobody likes accepting that its not a real medical problem. if you see that it happens in certain places and situations, how can it be a medical problem. i was embarrassed with myself to admit it. nothing to be embarrassed about. this can happen to anyone. its not an irrational fear when you dont know for sure whats causing it. you need to find out from a doctor and let them do the diagnosing.</data>

  <data key="d1">you said you had health anxiety, thats why i made the recommendations i did. there must be a reason why you would be on a forum for anxiety. are you sure the real problem is medical? in any event you need a proper diagnosis by a professional. with or without a real existing health issue we are all prone to suggestion. and its not easy to know. it can feel and be so real. but it cant kill you. in generalized anxiety, its quite common to have symptoms when youre distracted, but its usually because youre constantly checking in on it and it becomes an unconscious habit like wiggling your feet.</data>

  <data key="d1">hello friend! we're in the same hole, i'm a little further up the climb out, looks like you're right at the bottom of this pit. once you've seen a few doctors, allowed them to run their diagnostics, and received a response, if nothing comes up and they do not seem worried, then you know the anxiety is what's driving your physical symptoms. anxiety creates real physical problems and symptoms in the body and it does it by physiological means. your feeling of can't breathe was the worst thing for me for the longest time. it was caused by silent reflux. it also affected my voice. this is because when you have chronic high levels of cortisol and adrenaline in your body, your stomach produces may more acid than it should. the physical symptom is real. the root cause is the stress of severe anxiety. same with physical pain that's a big one i'm dealing with right now. anxiety causes you to tense your muscles subconsciously. that creates pain. one muscle that can get really so tense it goes into spasm is your diaphragm. that can make it feel really hard to breathe and make stomach pain worse by squeezing your stomach. that was what happened to me i wound up getting an endoscopy and going to 3 or 4 different gastroenterologists to be told nothing is wrong from their view. that only got better when i started working with a physical therapist. right now i have some of the same speech things as you but less severe. what happens if you soldier through the first 510 minutes of a conversation? i swear i sound like a stroke patient for the first 510 minutes, slurring words, saying wrong words, etc. but after 510 minutes it just goes away. i have an mri on thursday for them to check about this and about a dizziness i feel. in tracking my symptoms, it's really clear that the dizziness comes when i am anxious. when i am calm and focused, it's gone. all this to say these things can all be real and all have anxiety as the underlying physiological cause. reduce the anxiety reduce the symptoms. and my personal tip is work with a caring and patient physical therapist. you fear your body now. learning to be with and trust your body again is a process.</data>

  <data key="d1">sorry to hear that. only a doctor is qualified to diagnose you. symptoms can be very real alright, but the trick is finding out whats causing it. this to me has all the tell tale signs of health anxiety. but again, im no doctor. i certainly am an expert in health anxiety from the school of hard knocks. make sure to get plenty of b vitamins to repair your nerves. saying things like my brain is broken, my lungs are dying and your heart is going to kill you does not help. again, let your doctors decide. your brain seems just fine. your able to state your case and put your ideas together well. theyve checked your lungs and theyre fine, i assume. you can really do a number on your oxygenco2 balance by being too conscious of it. i can tell you that from experience. be sure to empty out your lungs every minute or so when that happens. even if your lungs dont feel like they fill entirely, you wont run out of oxygen. remember, if this is heath anxiety, health hysteria in my case years ago, its quite common and nothing to worry about as hard as that is to grasp. i hung on to the idea there was something wrong with me for too long at the same time that i knew it was my own suggestion and anxiety related. i just didnt see the contradiction between realizing i had panic disorder which perhaps you dont and thinking there was something wrong with me physically. i knew my mind was causing it yet i was looking for a physical cause. now i look at and think wtf. the other tell tale sign was that my symptoms changed every other week. as soon as i became immune to one fear, my subconscious mind would conjure up another symptom. id start getting one symptom, like seeing a fuzzy edge around objects because i just got up, and id wonder if that was a symptom of anxiety and then it was say hello to my newest symptom. perhaps that doesnt ring true for you but id thought id throw that out there. the biggest barrier to my recovery was realizing it was auto suggestion, psyching myself up to not be afraid of it with the expectation of it not happening, and then getting scared out of my gourd when it did, thinking well i guess i didnt convince myself well enough. the solution was to be okay with having symptoms, not merely convincing myself it wasnt dangerous so that it wouldnt happen. i have a feeling youre going to be okay.</data>

  <data key="d1">no it makes perfect sense why that is so scary when you have no belief for the afterlife. you either have to make peace with just thinking your soul dies in the grave with you, or you realize someone made our intricate bodies and how crazy this earth is. no way it was a big boom in my eyes, so i know in my heart that their is an afterlife. i dont have to talk about what god i believe in but just know i feel the most at peace about death i ever have with knowing where i am going when i die.</data>

  <data key="d1">if you have an anxiety disorder it shortens your lifespan by 5 yrs cause the stress and anxiety is bad for the heart. thats why most animals feel the need to reproduce so atleast when they die their dna will live on. theres nothing wrong with wasting your time watching shows and listening to music. most people are corporate slaves and don't have the luxury to travel around the world and explore. so we have to find gratification in smaller things.</data>

  <data key="d1">what's funny to think about and might help put things into perspective, is that technically whatever is outside of life is the more familiar thing. whatever we experienced prelife lasted from the beginning of time to birth. and postlife is whenever you pass for all eternity. you weren't scared of being outside of existence before and maybe you can find peace in knowing its likely there will be only that peace after. make the most of the time you have, mortality is what gives life meaning.</data>

  <data key="d1">same hereim trying to break some of those habits personally, but its not easy. the medical anxiety i get from having health issues, being afraid to go to the doctor in case i get a bad diagnosis, and then googling my symptoms is a vicious cycle and im really considering starting some sort of anxiety medication to help. im already in therapy but its just not doing as much as i wish it would yk? i was raised catholic in a very toxic churchschool community and no longer feel comfortable being a part of that faith, so i really dont know what will be there after im gone. i like to say im not afraid of dying defending my bad habits but if i really wasnt, would i be spiraling over some chest pain? right there with you homie, right there with you</data>

  <data key="d1">it could be some gerd from anxiety that is causing you to feel nauseous. i felt nauseous for about two years every night due to anxiety, and i found that using two pillows or even 34 at a very difficult period to prop my head up really helped. it stops stomach acid travelling up and can make you feel better.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have terrible covid anxiety and am currently recovering from an anxiety attack because there were so many unmasked people when i went to petsmart this morning and they were all too close to me while i was waiting on line to check out. its scary and its draining. i know so many people who have caught it over the past few weeks. none of them have been hospitalized one went to the er for a little bit, but he has a preexisting blood condition that makes him high risk and all have recovered, but it was still pretty miserable for most of them. im a teacher and my school is currently open and we have 25 of staff and students out sick. im exposed to positive people pretty much everyday at this point, and although i was boosted last month, i feel like im just waiting for my turn to get messed up for a week. im doing everything i can to try to protect myself, but im still so anxious about it and i cant shake the anxiety. its running me down and eating me alive.</data>

  <data key="d1">i cant imagine what its like to be a teacher right now. i have tremendous respect for you and what you do. youre pushing through it like a champ, and eventually things will get much better. eventually. in the meantime, im definitely in the same boat as you, as far as knowing people who have been infected so far. for some vaccinated folks, its like a really nasty head cold. for others, theyre completely asymptomatic and only found out about their covid through routine testing for work and travel. i hope ifwhen i get covid, ill be among the asymptomatic folks. but, i have to remind myself often that if i do get sick, i will survive it just fine. my aunt is an er nurse, and shes had to convert part of the er into a covid unit. thing is, shes yet to admit a single fully vaccinated person for covid. according to my states colorado covid hospital dashboard, 93 of those occupying the icu beds are unvaccinated individuals. 85 of those in the nonicu units for covid are unvaccinated. the vaccinated individuals who have been admitted for covid are not nearly as sick as those unvaccinated, and all of them will make full recoveries with just a bit of oxygen and rest. still, as someone who has been hospitalized due to cf before, i know that hospital stays, regardless of the reason, suck major ass. the prospect of needing medical care and not being able to get it freaks me the hell out. but, if we can survive the next few weeks without an incident requiring medical help, then things will get better. again, we just have to repeat these logicbased mantras to ourselves to keep on chugging. yes, petsmart was scary with all the unmasked individuals in there, but the vaccines are still north of 80 effective at preventing symptomatic infections, and are near 100 effective at preventing hospitalization and death. what are the chances that you caught a covid virus poignant enough to evade the vaccine and put you in the hospital, while standing in line at petsmart? probably almost zero. logic like that really helps me daytoday when dealing with this pandemic. its kept me relatively sane for two full years.</data>

  <data key="d1">anxiety and depression are known to co exist for a lot of people. sometimes anxiety will be more present and then anxiety will lessen and depression will take over. depends on the person but i experience both. ive realized there isnt always a trigger and sometimes it just happens and ive learned to understand that even when its hard. but when you mention quitting drinking that can absolutely be a cause of the depression. this is because there is nothing more to artificially boost your dopamine. your brains reward system is in shock, and it will take time to recover. depending on how often you drink your brain becomes dependent on alcohol to function so when you take that away it cause chemical changes. essentially your brain and body dont know how to communicate without alcohol so it takes them a bit to catch up to speed and get into a new and better routine. even tho its been two weeks your body is still feeling different and needs time to rest and adjust. thats awesome you quit tho, it takes a lot of courage to do so! anyways, thats my medical career talking but in all seriousness, your depressive symptoms dont always mean something crazy bad is happening, it could be because anything even as simple as a change in sleep routine or diet or stress.</data>

  <data key="d1">this. i could feel my anxiety coming on for a few days 2 weeks ago, then for the last week ive had insane physical symptoms 247. shortness of breath, lump in my throat, tight chest, burning in my chest and arm, racing heart, headaches, everything you could think of to the point where i went to urgent care yesterday to get my heart fully checked and of course they said it was fine. so last night i took my first dose of sertralinezoloft and hydroxyzine and finally got a bit of sleep but the sertraline all today has been giving me this burningtingling sensation in my neck, jaw, ears, and back of my head and i still feel short of breath and like my throat has something stuck in it. i feel like a shell of myself and its just not getting any better, just progressively worse. trying to work from home thank god and take care of my 2 kids has become impossible.</data>

  <data key="d1">it depends on the medication, if it's a right fit for you and whatever other treatment you have if you have it. for me it helped a lot, my family noticed it and i did too after a while. now that i'm changing my medication i'm currently at a low before i get adjusted to the new meds and i remember how i felt before medication and how much it helped. it's not a permanent solution but it definitely gives you some balance so you can work through your issues, and it made me more functional. but just remember that while you get adjusted to them you might feel bad for a while.</data>

  <data key="d1">could be more, depending on the medication, i don't know for sure. you can start feeling the intended effects of the medication in three weeks or a whole month, but i didn't feel absolutely awful for the entire time, for me it was worse at first. if it gives you a bad low is there someone you can talk to, can you call whoever is handling your treatment for an emergency appointment? it probably won't come to that, but for if it makes you feel safer about the whole thing.</data>

  <data key="d1">you are not a burden, and you certainly didn't ask for all these health problems. they are scary to you and to your family, and i'm sure they felt nothing but relief to discover the pain you had recently wasn't serious. you'll note the way i put that, i hope, because it should be dismissed as just gas. you felt pain that felt a lot like pain you'd felt before that could have been very serious you were right to get it checked out. pain is your body's warning system that something is wrong, and it's reassuring to know that this time, there wasn't anything. but always listen to it, as it could tell you things that save your life. you are 17 years old, and that means it's still your family's responsibility to take care of you. you're aware of that responsibility in ways you weren't when you were a child, and that shows a great deal of maturity and generosity of spirit on your part. but no one considers that a burden. nobody can help illness, and you sound like you've been through a lot of it during a rough time to be sick, what would covid and all. anxiety would be totally normal right now! like pain, anxiety is a warning system too. and like pain, sometimes it's not serious after all. sometimes we worry over things that are not clear and present dangers, but that's okay because like pain, it goes away. as you feel better, turn the negative feelings of worry about being a burden into positives, expressing love and gratitude to your family. let them know you appreciate their looking after you, and that way you can hear from them but i know they will tell you we love you so much, and we're just happy you're okay. i'm also happy you're on the mend! hugs to you and your family.</data>

  <data key="d1">hope you are compassionate with yourself. your awareness of this not being a longterm solution is the first step, and it's good that you can be real with yourself. i would say that harm reduction is the way to go here. if ativan occasionally is better than raw dogging reality, then take the pill. but knowing it's not good for you, also try to focus on doing the things that can help your life aside from that mindsetinternal focus and external factorsenvironment. if a pill helps you cope sometimes, so be it. coping is better than feeling completely lost and destructivewithout a lifeline. but a step above coping is even better. i recommend reading the research on plantearth medicines ie even cbd could help with anxiety. be careful about dosage and remember with any medicine use, it doesn't have to be all or nothing. do what you need to do for you to be able to copeheal. and keep your head up. this is a difficult time. so please be easy on yourself.</data>

  <data key="d1">sure sounds like generalized anxiety disorder, i have that. the feeling of impending doom really sucks! id suggest talking to a psychiatrist or therapist for a diagnosis, especially if youve been feeling this way for a long time. best of luck!</data>

  <data key="d1">have you gotten bloodiest? just to make sure you don't have a bad thyroid or some sort of electrolytes imbalance. i did the other day because i can hardly do anything anymore without having anxiety or even a panic attack. once i've made sure i'm healthy waiting on doc i'll either live with it and learn to cope or get meds to help. i don't want to be on meds tho. goodluck. you're not alone!</data>

  <data key="d1">how old are you? i definitely think its our brains. i think its also maybe genetic. my mother was a hot fucking mess, man. i love her to death but i definitely inherited the crazy in her. i use that in quotations because over time ive learned were all a bit crazy at least in my experience, everyone processes life a bit differently and its almost normal to have some mental health stuff going on. anxiety is no fun to deal with when youre going through it, but theres ways to deal with it. therapy can help and so can medication. we have options. so thats nice because even if this is a part of us? there will be options for us to coexist maybe someday youll even learn to appreciate parts of your anxiety like for me personally, i feel anxious when im not giving something my all. i wouldnt say thats a bad form of anxiety because i appreciate that little part of me that holds me accountable! absolutely a fringe case scenario there, but hope my point makes sense hehe so i hope you explore some therapy and keep talking about your anxiety. how it defines parts of your experience and how you aspire to change that. im also happy to answer any questions you might have granted im no therapist, i definitely have experienced what its like to feel crushed by anxiety. keep up the good fight you got this!</data>

  <data key="d1">this is a pretty normal symptom of anxiety, unfortunately. because you do not want to feel these unpleasant sensations in your body, you fight against it. and of course you don't want to feel these feelings, but what is often worse is the fear of the loss of control. these sensationsand your reaction to themmay cause you to realize that you're not always totally in control of your thoughts and body, and so it's natural to fear losing these faculties all together i.e. psychosis. there are a whole host of techniques to try and get through these episodes mindfulness, breathing techniques, radical acceptance, distraction, medication. you just have to find which is going to work for you, as we're all different.</data>

  <data key="d1">i just want someone to reassure us tbh. i want it all to stop. but my only advice is stop looking at all of it. stop looking at the news. the less u know the better unfortunately. people say its selfish to be ignorant but wtf can we do. im only using my phone to text friends. avoiding all the articles everything. i cant stomach it.</data>

  <data key="d1">one of the things i learned through studying dbt books to help my students when returning to schools after some covid restrictions were lifted apart from distress control was to focus on the things that you can change and the things you can do to make yourself feel better. you can send some financial aid to affected areas, if you can help with translation and interpreting for refugees, try to do that. but if you can't, just be with friends and family, reassure each other, be each other's distractions. kinda hard when the war is happening on our borders not even 200km from where i live, and even harder for people in ukraine. sadly us regular humans are the ones who suffer.</data>

  <data key="d1">i struggle with this immensely. most of the time i am running away from the eerie silence that follows once my brain is not fixated on any shitty post or random scrolling. i keep playing numerous podcasts in the background just for the noise. it gets scarier at night. to break the cycle i did a few things that has helped me i have learnt that there will always be relapses. i am going to share my two cents worth knowledge, hope it helps. 1. the moment i wake up in the morning, i turn on the zen mode in my phone for atleast an hour. it locks my phone and i can only make and receive calls, even restarting the phone doesn't undo it. i use this moment to either stand near the window if it's raining or go for a walk, standing in an open area like balcony also helps 20 minutes. in the beginning each minutes felt like hours and i was really anxious, but within 34 days i started noticing changes. i was calmer, more positive and felt a little in control of my anxiety. 2. before going to bed repeat the same thing. keep the phone on zen mode. this was harder in comparison to the morning routines. in the first week, i started listening to yoga nidra right before sleeping. i cannot stress enough how much this helped me. i slept better, and woke up feeling refreshed. 3. i started doing 30 minutes of sun salutations. not even a single minute more than that. my spine is better and so is my mind. my focus, concentration and energy is better. it might seem overwhelming with anxiety beginning something is the hardest, atleast for me it is but it whatever you wish for can actually happen. these little changes have helped me in taking control of my days gradually. it took me approximately 15 days to feel in complete control, it could take you lesser number of days or longer. the result of it is that i eat healthier and make more healthier choices. again, relapses are a part of it and try to be kind to yourself if you slip. if you are into podcasts, i would recommend you to listen to huberman podcast, episode 53 , the science of making and breaking habits .</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm a seasoned doomscroller, but i started getting into that whole we're living in the matrix idea and learned the obvious everything is built to keep you scrolling. every app tailors specifically to what will capture your attention at that moment, which causes more anxiety and keeps pulling you further away from the current moment. i started taking steps to escape this because i was literally scrolling even when i was bored with it and didn't want to anymore. i had trained my brain to chase that dopamine high literally every minute of the day and would feel like shit if i wasn't scrolling or on a video game. i started meditating to reprogram myself to be okay with being bored. it's hard and i'm still struggling with doing it daily, but shit, its actually helping. your brain is similar to your muscles. if you work out, your muscles get stronger. if you practice being bored and being okay with boredom, your brain will start noticing. def do some research on this stuff, it may be what you need! just try to stick to scientific fact and psychology, don't get stuck going down the rabbit hole of the matrix theory. there's way more to it than just being a conspiracy theory.</data>

  <data key="d1">hear me out here... anxiety is a sneaky mfer. it likes to fill in the blanks with the worst possible outcome. instead of doomscrolling, try reading some resources that contain opinions from people who are experienced with this sort of thing... current or former secretaries of state, defense ministers, well respected analysts, etc. the news will take putin saying nuclear arms are not off the table and print a headline like is nuclear war around the corner? while people who have dealt with the situation and don't have to generate clicks will tell you that of course any country is going to say that. it's the ultimate in sabre rattling. but the distance between making such a statement and executing the command is vast. for example i have a habit of finding lumps on my body. i do a little research, and webmd tells me i may already be a dead man walking. a couple of weeks later, my doctor palpates it for 5 seconds and tells me it's nothing to worry about. information can set you free, when you leave no blanks for anxiety to fill in.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey this is a very real problem. i have been a victim of doomscrolling as well. i'm an app developer, me and my team have built an app that's completely free to solve our personal and exactly the same problem of doomscrolling. it's called regain. regain acts as a mindful coach to help you avoid doomscrolling on apps like instagram. people have put in millions and millions of dollars to get ourselves addicted. it's time we also build technology first tools to act for the users in opposing directions. you could easily save 25 of your screentime with regain. here's the link, do share feedback on how to improve the app</data>

  <data key="d1">it took a combination of mindfulness and a cognitive therapy approach for me to get the upper hand on anxiety. i recommend reading books and meditation. they can be kind of boring but then suddenly, you have breakthroughs, start improving and things start to make sense. cognitive therapy for dummies is a pretty good workbook. it teaches you how to think rationally and how to recognize anxiety triggers and prevent panic attacks before they start. you need to follow the book 100 and study it often when you finish. read some 'eckhart tolle' books as well. you need to devote at least an hour per day to get yourself through this. it's worth it to get your life back. counseling helps too, but you need to do lots of self work to really get there.</data>

  <data key="d1">it might not be your fault that youre overthinking and might be a more sensitive person. the first thing you can do is to change your way of thinking, try telling yourself 12 positive things about yourself and see how you feel at the end of the week. im also the same i take everything the wrong way and dont know how to read context and overanalyze what people say and think about it for hours. you just gotta build it up in yourself to not care what people think. its hard but eventually you will not care what anything negative anyone has to say about you.</data>

  <data key="d1">you have to remember anxiety has very real physical symptoms. your body naturally has a fight or flight response built in. this response can cause sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, chest pain or discomfort your muscles tensing up causes the stress that makes you feel this, dizziness, nausea, tingling, numbness, chills, hot flashes. and those are only the physical symptoms on top of the mental burden of panic attacks. i know its very scary but its all explained by anxiety. i know its hard to accept and youll convince yourself its a heart attack but i cant tell you how many times i was sure i was dying and ive always come out the other side. panic attacks suck. youre not alone though. also people say focus on breathing but that never works for me either. i like going on a walk outside. i feel like i can breathe better outside and walking helps me feel more in control.</data>

  <data key="d1">if you were having a heart attack i'm sure you'd know for certain that that's what it was. i struggle with paying too much attention to my heart beat so i've been worried about circulatory problems for years, but i don't have any. i also get weird breathing things pretty often too. the worst was back when my anxiety first started i had two days where i was manually breathing and it was terrifying. i was so scared that if i'd quit paying attention to my breathing that i would just stop breathing but that didn't happen. weird things like that and many, many, many more are all parts of anxiety. there are a lot of muscles in your chest and being tight so often from anxiety can cause them to start hurting which is most likely what you're feeling. i know it's a lot easier said than done but try to relax, watching some interesting videos on the internet or going for a long quiet walk or bike ride helps me.</data>

  <data key="d1">theres nothing wrong with expressing how you feel and if she chooses to go out with you over going out with her friends it shouldnt be because of pity but because she wants to and cares about you and the relationship. she might be taking you for granted which is not cool. suggest some plans in advance. if she keeps avoiding them then somethings not right. calm communication and clarity. keeping it bottled up will blow up sooner or later.</data>

  <data key="d1">chest pains can be from anxiety but i believe my own symptoms match up closer to something called costochondritis as its usually occuring around the center of my chest where the sides of my sternum is. i understand how it feels to be anxious about chest pain, i was anxious too at first. i had to go to a cardiologist where they took images of my heart, did a stress test and ekgs. all they found was an inverted t wave abnormality which isnt necessarily immediately a bad thing, as it seems some people can just have it and be fine. in fact, i even saw some articles linking depression and anxiety to this abnormality. however, later testing showed it was back to normal. which was strange to me, but oh well. tests concluded that my heart was healthy and i was not at all likely for a heart attack any time in the next few years. but being anxious about it made it so much worse. i remember it hurting every day, and i would even get palpitations which would just re affirm the illusion that something was wrong. in the end nothing was wrong. the cardiologist told me if you press down on your chest and it feels tender and it hurts, then its either a musculoskeletal issue or an anxiety one. a heart attack wont hurt if u press down on your chest, since you wont actually be pressing down on your heart. i say see your primary care doctor and voice your concerns, all it takes is a simple visit to the office. if they think its necessary to test you they will, however you are more than likely to be okay especially if youre young. if the ekg was normal, thats a very good sign and not something to be upset about.</data>

  <data key="d1">i had chest pain and shallow breathing back in college so 23m at the time that turned out to be caused by anxiety. i was in my 9th semester with 10 major history papers to write, probably a combined total of around 75 pages to research and write, and less than 2 months to do it. saw the cardiologist, did the ecg and an ultrasound, and everything came back normal. somehow the idea of dropping out comes up. i talk with my parents and the campus pastor, and i take some time to think it over. about 9pm that night wednesday maybe? i make the decision to drop out. about 3045 minutes after that those physical symptoms are completely gone. the technical term for the symptoms i was experiencing is psychosomatic symptoms. physical symptoms that are being caused by something going on mentally. and when you get physical tests that show nothing wrong you start to worry more, so you end up in a really annoying feedback loop. i can't say that this is exactly what you are dealing with being an internet random but it seems likely. if you have a therapist, or even if you go to talk to your gp or another specialist, tell them that your anxiety has also been worse lately. they should know where to go from there.</data>

  <data key="d1">realizing that you might be in a loop is a big step towards getting out of it. you may not be able to get yourself completely out on your own, but coping skills like breathing exercises, sensory tools, or listening to music may help manage it. the big benefit of talking to a doctor or therapist is the confirmation they can give you about what's going on. from what you said they looked for physical causes of your physical symptoms. a mental cause may not have occurred to them. when they find out you deal with anxiety they can help make all of the different pieces of this puzzle fit together. and once you understand what's happening to you it gets a lot less scary.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have gone to the er for this before, most recently because i told the nurse i called at my gp's office that i had chest pains and they sent me to the er. that was about a year ago. i'm not sure where you are, but where i am northern illinois if you go to the er they tell you to schedule a followup appointment with your normal doctor. when the scheduler asks what the appointment is for just say er followup. easy way to avoid the chest pain? go directly to er, do not pass go response. when you're face to face with your doctor, or even the nurse, that's when you say i've been really anxious lately, could that be connected to these symptoms? it may sound like a leading question, but it's the question you need answered. and it should lead the doc to look at all the results with a better context to get you the answer you need.</data>

  <data key="d1">if what you are feeling has you worried enough that you need to go to the er then do that. you need to do what is necessary to take care of yourself. there may be a mental health help line you could call, but as soon as you say chest pain they'll probably send you to the er. when i went to the er a year ago they had a social worker on duty that came into my room for an assessment. i would recommend asking about that while you're there if you go.</data>

  <data key="d1">time to drop another psych term you may or may not be familiar with cognitive distortions, specifically projection. cognitive distortions are basically the ways we change how we think about something. don't worry, every human on the planet does these things, and probably a bunch of animals too. right now, you are saying that they are talking badly about you, judging you, and generally imagining them looking down on you. in reality they are all seeing dozens, if not hundreds, of patients a day. they don't have time to sit around and judge patients, and privacy laws mean there isn't much they can discuss. so try not to project your assumptions about how they might behave onto them. it will help you interact with them more easily while also freeing up some brain power for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">wow, that was fast. still, there are upsides to this. 1 you are not dying. always good. 2 you now have a new set of data to go with your symptoms from today. that'll be useful for your gp, therapist, andor whichever kind of doctor you talk to next. 3 i know i had a 3rd point but i've completely forgotten what it was. my advice keep reminding yourself that the er staff are confident that you are healthy enough to be allowed to go home on your own. physically you are healthy and safe. schedule an appointment to see your gp, therapist, or psychiatrist. then try to avoid planning or scheduling anything else related to this after this next appointment. this next one is where you'll start planning the next ones, so there's no point thinking farther ahead. i need to get to sleep, but i'll leave you one piece of advice that a therapist gave me how do you eat an elephant? one bite at a time.</data>

  <data key="d1">as someone who once lastminute cancelled a semester abroad because of cold feet, let me tell you everything is fine and you can do this! if you regret leaving, you can always come back. if you stay though, you might forever regret not having taken that chance. its totally normal to get scared and have second thoughts the day before leaving. try to just see it as what it is your anxiety trying to keep you from doing what you wanted for so long. you put a lot of thought into doing this and you can trust in yourself that it is a good decision to go, even though it comes with some notsoeasy parts, like not seeing your mom and dogs for a while. they know you love them and theyre not going anywhere. you might be far away, but you wont be out of this world. youll be so proud of yourself once youve taken that step and it will be worth it, im sure!!</data>

  <data key="d1">i studied abroad, i thought of canceling my flight every time i had to go back to the country of my studies. thankfully i never did. inevitably, there are things that i have lost by being away, but i grew up so much emotionally in a way that can't be done had i listened to my fears. solitude in a foreign place will teach you a lot about yourself. it won't be coping with loneliness as much as it is finding comfort in your own company. experiencing new things in an unfamiliar place for the first time in adulthood has a weird lovely flavor that can't be described unless you tried it yourself. also, there are many esl teachers in south korea, it can be a great chance to form lifelong relationships with people who are in the same boat. good luck and have a safe flight!</data>

  <data key="d1">i actually had an episode in ae this weekend. i've had chest pains for 4 months now and was told its anxiety. i went to the gym sunday to try and get back into workouts, and the pain got worse so i went home. that evening i said fuck it, i'm doing some squats as its all in my head, pain got real bad so i went to ae. whilst waiting in the queue, i collapsed. my heart rate was at 40 bpm usually 80 resting in the build up to this, i felt a rush to my head, a rush like the blood was exiting my brain. i woke up on the floor with doctors rushing to me. for the next minute or two, i was in and out of conciousness, 40 heart rate, convulsing and pupils going wild. they began hooking me up to an ecg but by time they were done, i had recovered. ecg normal, blood all normal. i guess for me, prior to passing out, once i feel that feeling going to my head i get super super anxious which maybe the reason for the collapse. when i was coming back round, i felt super drunk. i assume because my brain was missing some oxygen. after i was fully back, my brain was buzzing like i'd woken up from a nap and had a shot of adrenaline. i'm due to see a cardiologist tonight, and hoping to get an echocardiogram and holter monitor. i do see people having similar symptoms as me on reddit, but it's just impossible for me to accept chest pain, fainting, bradycardia being anxiety. i'm not sure if i prefer it being anxiety or a heart condition.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, any updates on that? i feel like i have the same condition except there is no chest pain for me. it usually happens after workout or having cold shower. i can feel my heart slowing down, my vision gets blurry, feeling super faint and i need to move, walk, jump otherwise i'm quite sure i would collapse. i've had ecg, holter for 24h and 72h, which found that i have pvcs, which is something i can feel a lot and is definitely something that makes me anxious. my pulse at night is around 40, sometimes even less. which i have been told is completely normal and i am healthy and those episodes are just panic attacks. but that's where i am afraid, because for most people panics raise heart pulse, they have that chest pain. for me it's like the opposite, slow heart rate, cannot feel my legs and arms, then fainting. sucks that this never happened to me while on holter monitor since i was relaxing like most of the time. well anyways wish you luck and the very best.</data>

  <data key="d1">not much has changed. i had an echo but imaging was poor so it was cancelled. i have a cardiac mri monday and a tilt table test in a few weeks to test for pots. if you're feeling faint, look into pots, although its more to do with your heart rate increasing significantly with posture changes.</data>

  <data key="d1">you are fine, and you are loved even though you do not know this. your pain is selfinflicted because of what others have told you about yourself. comparing you to others, showing you others who are socalled perfect judging you, berating you, labeling you with addhdhahdahh type of labels, medicating you to get you to be normal. and now, you are judging yourself with those words. but who are you? who really are you? i will confess to you that you are immortal, eternal, omniscient and omnipotent force of life, you are life itself. you can do and be whatever you want. do not judge this body that you are, and its deeds. you do not know yourself and believe yourself to be this body, but you are not the body, you are the light that sees this body. seek to know yourself and you will be whole, unified pure unconditional love. this, is a confession to you with all my being, is what you are. beleive in me and this truth.</data>

  <data key="d1">i live with my mom im 32, i barely started school and used to think very little of myself. it took me about two years of going to counseling and practicing talking to my self in a more positive way to finally start automatically doing it, i still talk shit to my self but now im more aware and correct myself. i think counseling is a god sent, get out those feelings u have and the thoughts. i would start writing a gratitude list of the things u do have in life, i can give u some , u have a place to live, ur able to communicate with people on the internet, ur letting out whats going on in this post. i live by this song lyric in the same way that everything good in life can be taken away so can all this pain we can overcome!!!! dont let ur brain fool u into thinking life is a horrible thing there is good in life u just have to find it, it takes work and u may not see the good right away but it will come! remember to look at ur victories no matter how small they may seem. im sorry ur dealing with this but i swear to u there is better out there waiting for u, u just got to find it!!!!</data>

  <data key="d1">it has. i'm a tax preparer with an understanding boss who was aware of my anxiety and tourette's from the outset as i'd been a client for some time before getting my staterequired license. i work seasonally, 24 8 hour days a week. she's eased me in to the social aspects of the job and i'm doing well. last year as a neophyte i did data entry for more experienced preparers, which let me practice and get feedback on my work without much client interaction mostly calls to get basic info. she noticed i did reasonably well when i was making the call, but could panic a bit on inbound calls which could be just about anything. this year i do phone interviews for dropoff clients. my lifelong phone anxiety is shockingly reduced at this point, and clients have been happy working with me which feels good. recently the complexityresponsibility level of the returns i'm completing myself has increased as both she and i have gotten more confident in both my work and client interactions. the few inperson interactions i've had with my clients have been great, too. recently i've covered for the receptionist both on the phone and at the front desk a fair bit when the other preparers are busy with appts and the receptionist is out, and that's gone well, too. my stomach still jumps a little when the phone rings and i need to answer it, i have to take a breath before picking up, but i can handle it. but i actually kind of like working the front desk inperson for short periods, which has been a huge surprise. this doesn't mean i'm anxietyfree though. i do pretty okay on mwf weeks, but 4 day weeks are rougher on me than i want to admit, despite that i like my work, my boss, my coworkers, and my clients. i can handle it because of those things, but i'd be struggling with permanent fulltime work, which makes me feel a little guilty sometimes. i'm actually awake right now because i had a really great, productive day at work and expressed some happiness to my boss, and that has triggered my anxiety, stupid as that is. i'm an overearnest dweeb. jumping right in to something like retail as has worked for some people would not have worked for me, but i see why it can! i recommend it if you can. i spent years basically never leaving the house when i was younger, and that was really not good.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes ive had all of these symptoms and more. my anxiety sent me to the er 7 times in 2021 and every single time, every single test came back perfectly normal. i was not dying nor was there anything wrong with me. i also got told i had ibs at one point, but anxiety heavily disrupts your digestion causing you stomach and bowel problems. once i started managing my anxiety a little better, bowel movements and stomach issues went back to normal. i still struggle often with my anxiety, so i know the symptoms can be terrifying.</data>

  <data key="d1">im a hypochondriac i feel ive gotten every symptom imaginable. at its peak i would go to the doctors weekly convinced i was dying i got a heart monitor, brain scans, xrays all over my body, and all types of blood work just to be told its anxiety. i would get sharp pains anywhere my face my throat my heart. anxiety can do a number on your muscles 99 of sharp pains end up being anxiety its more common than you think. try to remember your anxiety in this situation isnt going to keep you safe and the chances of it being anxiety vs something detrimental are 99.9 to 0.01. i would try health anxiety affirmations i listen to them on youtube by theanxietyguy also reminding yourself of the facts it would be extremely rare for it to be cancer and when it is the symptoms are undeniable you can see it right away through lumps or large white spots in your throat think of the symptoms you dont have instead. the impending doom is the worst part of hypochondria more often then not things will be okay. hope this helps</data>

  <data key="d1">i find i dislike traditional meditation too. now, maybe i'm just not doing it correctly and it would be different if i were under proper instruction...but simply sitting down, focusing on breathing and whatnot just annoys me, tbh. every time i've tried it it just creates space for spiraling thoughts. that said, meditation can be achieved in other ways that may not seem obvious. painting, dancing, or throwing myself into things i'm passionate about is a form of it for me i've found. that's the way i get to a calmer place, or at least, to a place where i'm able to have a more singular, manageable moment of clearheadedness where i feel good or better. so, i'd say try looking into those sorts of avenues if you wish to achieve such a state, it doesn't have to be crosslegged on the floor at all.</data>

<node id="7510">
  <data key="d0">comment</data>
  <data key="d1">so there's a few things to do to determine legitimacy. 1. customer support is usually initiated by the customer. if customer support were the first to reach out, this may be an indicator that they may be a support scam, or may be phishing you for personal information. if you reached out to them, it's more likely to be real 2. you went via their official website. googling a company name and finding the official site is usually a safe way to do this. e.g. if i google canon and scroll past the ad results, i see their official uk website. finding a tech support addresschat on that website is safe. if instead i googled canon tech support and a result took me to the address canonsupport.io i would be very suspicious of the link and any customer support interaction. in general as long as it's an interaction that you initiated via an official website, then an image sent to you is very unlikely to be a scamhack. an employee would be very easy to trace this back to, and scammershackers like to remain in the background.</data>

  <data key="d1">mirtazapine got me out of a terrible anxiety period that felt like a two week long panic attack. it knocked me straight to sleep and the next day i felt soooo much better and totally not panicked. long term i wont lie ive reached bad points again, but im sure i would be so much worse without the mirtazapine. i am hopefully gonna start another med on top of the mirtazapine for breakthrough anxiety, but overall i really recommend it</data>

  <data key="d1">late to the party but hope this helps 1 it works also less sexual ses than ssris 2 good for sleep 3 its also good if you have allergies anecdotal it works as an antihistamine 4 if youre a bit drowsy on it, increasing the dose from 15mg to 30mg can help 5 beware the munchies though i took up weightlifting on it and it really helped with eating enough protein just dont have too much junk food laying around</data>

  <data key="d1">i am a person who suffers from gad and is also highly sensitive. i once took a bong hit that sent me into my first real bad panic attack psychotic episode. at the time i didnt know i was having a panic attack and was convinced that people were trying to kill me or that i had already hit my head and died and i was living in some weird purgatory! anyway i made my friend call an ambulance and they took me to the er. i explained what happened, the doctors checked me out, gave me some valium, i slept it off in a chair at the hospital, woke up and felt better. you will be fine. my honest advice is pot and gad highly sensitive personality types do not mix well with weed unfortunately.</data>

  <data key="d1">i used to smoke daily, but it started making my anxiety worse so i stopped. now it makes me extremely nauseous but thats a lil different. i have gad from what helped when i did smoke its legal where im at is indicas. sativas or hybrids messed me up. also, edibles can be tricky as you cant quite control how much you digest if theyre homemade its a cropshoot on the dosage. id say stay away from weed all together, but if not, my recommendation is there.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've always had mini panick attacks from weed that i would talk myself out of but one day, i got so high off a weed pen that i literally tweaked so bad. it felt like i was in a movie and that i would go insane. i had to leave where i was to go back to my dorm. after that i was nervous to even be around the smell of weed, but it got better, i tried a new strain and it worked better for me so i'd suggest that and also smoking in moderation. things will get better i promise and as for the anxiety, i suffer from anxiety also, so that made me quit smoking as a whole</data>

  <data key="d1">you don't trip on cannabis. 'tripping' is experienced with psychedelics. that being said, yeah, it's pretty common for those with anxiety disorders to have negative reactions to thc. everyone is different though so use sparingly or not at all if you've had this reaction.</data>

  <data key="d1">i had to just stop completely. i do take derivatives of weed now, but i definitely don't smoke street rubbish anymore. you never know what you're getting. sometimes i'd have a good time usually with a good sativa blend, sometimes i'd have a terrible time. couch lock absolutely ruins me. being locked in with everything going so slow fucking terrifies me. i dissociated in a store once for what felt like hours and my friends left me standing there, still don't know how long i was there, could have been 2 minutes, could have been hours. weed panic on a bus, weed panic with hula hoops british crispschips stuck in my throat because of cotton mouth, greening out in the middle of the city, i could go on. the bad eventually outweighed the good. i just can't smoke, and maybe you should look into that too. it helps some people but it really hinders others. the 'you just haven't found the right strain bro' dudes are the worst for this. some people just can't smoke. simple as. if you already have bad reactions, it's human nature not to go back for more.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes i am going through something similar at the moment. and i know the feeling of wanting to 'sleep it away'. it never works. i wake up on my days off in a bit of a panic, all i want to do is drift off back to sleep and wake up feeling fine. this never happens. my current routine involves getting up after trying to go back to sleep, there's always an attempt, have a shower, have some breakfast and go for a walk. by then i have usually calmes a little bit but not always. i know this will pass and i will be able to gently fall back to sleep in the mornings but at the moment i accept its just not happening. frustrating i know!</data>

  <data key="d1">yes! this happens to me too and will gradually fade away each day but each random episode or whatever this is happens for about a week intensely enough to up my anxiety into panic and desperate ways to try and figure out what it is. the next week will be like pins and needles or numb unless it goes away. by then ive wasted half a month freaking out because the feelings are very real and i find it hard to believe nothing is happening. i've thought i may have nerve damage from long term meds. ive thought maybe i was developing an allergy to something because my skin especially my face will feel different. then i realize im not perceiving touch the way i normally do...i feel the pressure but its like i don't feel the details of the surface. my fingershands feel numb too. i can tell my hands what to do but my armhand gives no feedback to the brain. its kinda scary, i try to calm my self down by thinking ok if you can never feel your forearm again but you can still move it how much does that matter? it could be worse. sometimes the best way i can describe it is like i can feel the blood pressure of certain areas. its like my nerves are too aware and telling my brain how the blood flow feels when normally that switch isn't meant to be turned on. its like a numb surface feeling on my neckback but tingles like slight electricity, a pins and needles feeling that's not as fast or intense and more of consistent flow of tingles and paralysis. i say it reminds me of blood pressure because based on my position the strength of the flow in the area changes, the feeling also changes intensity based on my heart rate. alsothe areas that feel dead on the surface don't recognize temperature. i feel a change but its deeper under the surface and doesn't transmit as hot or cold just different than next to it. larger body parts like my neckback will feel nothing even when its freezing and usually im always cold at normal room temperatures. other times its super hot and i don't feel anything, ill pile on blankets and then wake up drenched in sweat.</data>

  <data key="d1">im 22 have these same fears. its scary. i always fear for when my time will come, honestly i have bad paranoia about my family members or husband passing. even though we have these fears, remember that they are just fears. when i have these thoughts, trying some mindfulness techniques to bring myself back to the present moment really helps. say out loud 3 things you see, 3 things you feel, 3 things you smell, etc. once youre focused calm in the present, try to remind yourself that everyones time comes, try to remember that death is a part of life. nothing is forever, things are always changing, its just nature. one thing everyone in the entire world shares in common is that we cant live forever. enjoy your life in the present, if you believe in reincarnation or find it interesting then try looking into religions surrounding it. many people find comfort in believing in something after death. i also morbidly if im being honest am comforted when i read stories of people who have had neardeath experiences, because i saw a documentary once about it noticed that most of the stories included people saying they felt nothing but intense euphoria peace. a few peoples stories even said that death was so peaceful, they almost didnt want to come back to their life when revived. sounds creepy but for some reason hearing other peoples real experiences makes me feel more prepared for whats after death even if i dont know for sure. one more thing that helps me a little is remembering the fact that truthfully, life isnt that easy. its full of good times bad times. when you die, i like to think that the hard part is over you can finally rest. sorry for the long comment, but i hope some of this helps to ease your mind a little bit. i have death anxiety far too often i know how scary it can be how little other people understand. when i voice my anxieties to my family or friends they tend to just think im being morbid depressing, so i just want you to know there are other people are out there understand what youre going through. i know how stressful it can be. godspeed.</data>

  <data key="d1">for me, i grab a really cold glass of water. sip on that. take slow deep breaths. sometimes turn on a tv show or try to scroll through something random on my phone. most times, this works. i need something cold to the touch and taste the water, some type of noise usually the tv even as background, something to see and touch my phone usually. i try to get all my senses going to get myself out of my own head so i can stop paying attention to my heart racing and breathing. but for the times it doesnt, i usually end up calling my mom sounds silly but shes helped me through my anxiety attacks since i was a teenager and knows to just talk about anything random to help get my mind off of it so i can calm down. my husband will keep asking me if im ok and what can he do and i honestly just need someone to talk about random stuff to get my head clear.</data>

  <data key="d1">if i continue with my first answer. you should check the list about foods what are bad for ibs individual's. i don't say that you have ibs, i just thought that if there is some foods what you had been eating in these 4 to 5 days. shrimps are mostly bad for ibs people. sushi is not that bad for me. how much did you ate? is there any chance that you have some kind of intestinal obstruction? stress can be bad for stomach too. a lot of stress shows pretty badly in stomach area.</data>

  <data key="d1">that sounds like heavy one there buddy! but yes...thats anxiety, pretty rough ain't it? just remember noone has ever died from anxiety. its not possible, its a mechanism designed to keep you alive which can ironically make you feel like your dying, aren't humans awesome? anyway, your body was firing on all cylinders. your going to be exhausted for quite some time. also your nervous system has taken a bit of a beating so it will be hypersensitive for a while. this means your likely to have what i call 'waves' of anxious feelings and mixed up emotions. youll feel on edge for a while. but as long as you take it easy and ride out those waves with some acceptance, patience, and not reacting to them with more panic, then in confident you'll be okay. may take a week or two to recover, or a little while longer as we're all different.</data>

  <data key="d1">that sounds like a rough one. ive been there as well. ive been doing better the past few days but today got a little weird. chest pressure out of nowhere. i was working outside for like 10 hours building one of those home depot canopies. i can contribute it to the fact that i was pretty much doing a workout for a long period of time, but my brain says heart attack of course. it has subsided but lasted a good 30 mins. weird thing is the pressure goes away when i lift my shirt away from touching my chest. maybe a hypersensitivity thing. who knows. anyway i hope you feel better. maybe one day well be able to rid ourselves of this rotten anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi, these symptoms sound very similar to my own. tension in all my muscles but especially my legs and an internal vibrating or buzzing feeling intermittently. i also occasionally get a sunburnt feeling on the skin of my feet, hands, and face. i'm 99 certain it's a chronic stress response and that my autonomic nervous system is stuck in fight or flight, like a car revving with the handbrake on. i had this evolve after 2.5 years of extreme stress as i dealt with pelvic floor dysfunction and a lot of fluctuating pain. i was already quite anxious about my health and prone to fixating on symptoms, but that experience psychologically shattered me and left me with ptsd. but i don't think the stress needs to be as extreme and longrunning as that i read some of your other posts about this. mono could have been both a physical and psychological strain on your body and primed your brain to notice unusual symptoms and catastrophize about them. your brain is like hey, last time something was off, i was actually really ill so maybe this other weird symptom is another sign something is wrong with me and maybe it's worse. something else that might be helpful i have a particular form of ocd, called sensorimotor, hyperawareness or somatic ocd. i think a lot of people with health anxiety and somatized anxiety symptoms have some of the same thought processes i now recognise as ocd. you recognise a symptom, often anxietyinduced, or a normal bodily sensation and become fixated on it, terrified either it represents a serious illness or that it will never leave your consciousness and ruin everything. because you've flagged this feeling or symptom as a dangerous thing, your brain keeps paying attention to it and, with anxietyinduced symptoms, your anxiety remains elevated so they don't subside. i've had small patches of these symptoms before, during times of high stress, but never became fixated on the symptom themselves so they ebbed. this time, with a lot of my pelvic floor dysfunction improved, i latched onto it and the anxiety became selfperpetuating. those previous experiences with the buzzing sensation, and with other sensorimotor obsessions, have shown me the way out though. you have to stop seeking a medical explanation or cure and stop ruminating on how you feel. i've realised that this time, i instantly catastrophised about how i was feeling e.g. i have a terrible illness andor i'm going to feel this way forever and my life will be ruined and started researching obsessively, and that has just sustained the anxiety and the symptoms. like 75 of my brain is focused on this at any given time. you have to just accept the way you're feeling right now and eventually your nervous system will calm down so the symptoms will subside and, equally importantly, your awareness of the symptoms will diminish. here i think ocd techniques can help</data>

  <data key="d1">it's possible you've built a tolerance to it, some people need to occasionally raise their dosage. life changes, stress, traumatic events can also worsen anxiety and make the meds feel less effective. seeing your prescriber is the right move.</data>

  <data key="d1">anxiety sucks im sorry you are feeling this way. i wish i had good advice, but i have the same problem. i find myself frequently worrying about what happens if i feel unwell or have a panic attack in a situation. i remember when i took my nclex exam to become a registered nurse i honestly felt like i was going to have a panic attack the entire time. i finished the test in about 30 minutes because i was so anxious to just get out of there and pretty sure i had palpitations and was hyperventilating for the duration of the test. at the end of the day i still passed my exam and became a nurse, which was a horrible career choice for me due to my aforementioned anxiety lol</data>

  <data key="d1">it could be related to some sort of anticipation anxiety. you know theres an event coming up and even what the event is, but you dont know what will actually happen at this event. it could be this fear of the unknown thats triggering the anxiety. that could be why you are anxious up until the event, but once youre there, its fine its no longer unknown. ive experience similar feelings. for me, the key was to understand what you can and cant control. can i control whats unknown to me? of course not. its a hard thing to work through for sure i had help from therapy. hoped this helped a little.</data>

  <data key="d1">im also the same! absolutely fine when im at the event but the build up makes me super anxious. one of the reasons i think my anxiety is worse is because i work from home and my closest friends dont live local. so when we do go out, theres a bit of a build up to it. i think gradually getting out the house and doing more will help in the long run. the more youre out of your comfort zone, the less anxious you will become.</data>

  <data key="d1">agreeing with the other comment diagnosed adhd around my soon to be 23rd birthday afab and still some undertones of anxiety disorder though i am going to get tested for autism which my siblings both have . you will be ok and will find your people. teenage years... omg you couldn't pay me to go back lol. they are hard, but it's really hard to top the things you feel then. it's a downhill battle basically, so if you can weather this, you will be fine 3 i have 2 friends in my life constsntly rn, and 3 whom i keep in contact with very rarely that are family to me. i even managed to find someone as a partner who understands my fucked up head that i don't even grasp. i started with nothing at your age too and was so very shy, but people either came to me or i went where i loved being only to connect with people you will find your tribe! i'm so sorry to hear that you've experienced more than i ever had so young. you don't deserve that. but you're also way stronger than a lot of kids i know, so don't forget that</data>

  <data key="d1">im 40. i had no friends as a young teenager at 13. felt suicidal about it. lonely. it does get better. or it has for me. at 14 i began to make a couple of friends. had a reasonable group of friends by 17, lots of close friends at 21. a week before my 40th i decided to have a party, and just invite everyone i knew. did think anyone would show up. people make plans in advance in their 40s. over 50 people did. we ran out of everything! i thought if only 13 year old me could see this but making friends does involve effort. ive had to learn how to do small talk talk about them, they prefer it! ive moved to new areas, and had to reach out and socialise with people who arent looking for new friends. anyway. you said the big thing is you cant hold a conversation. thats the first step. so set yourself a goal of causally chatting to someone about their life for 5 minutes, or even 2 minutes. you also need a rough idea about the things most people your age are into. it doesnt matter if they hate you afterwards as youre not looking to make friends at the moment. just get talking to people. talk to your therapist about this too. if you know any adults who are socialable ask them to teach you how to work a room, or do small talk with adults.</data>

  <data key="d1">i completely understand where youre coming from and from my experience there is hope 29m diagnosed recently with mild aspergers. i was never one that joined in on the drama, was always on the outside of social circles and didnt really understand what or why the others kids did what they did. because i was different. just like everybody is. a few things ive learnt along the way that i wish i knew when i was your age 1 those who care dont matter and those who matter dont care. people are going to judge, gossip, nitpick, hen peck, whatever to organise their social heirarchy for where they are at the time. in school its very dynamic because the people that are there this year arent necessarily there next year and the groups that are formed now from kindergarten or primaryelementary school are still fairly strong. as you go through the years from 710 the groups will diverge, some will move from one to the other and those that branch across the groups will grow the most. by 1112 or senior years, all the different cliques just merge together to one big group and everybody becomes friends in one way or another. dont understand completely how or why, but it just does. getting back to the point, the people along the way that care about the social rules super specifically that they wont hang with certain kids or groups. dont pay them any heed, even if you had their attention youll find out pretty quickly theyre actually boring people. instead, the quiet, the geeky and the creative people are some of the most interesting people youll ever meet. also some of the kindest too. they wont care so much if you hang with one person or the next and instead theyll care more about you the individual or what you contribute to the conversation. these are the people you want to find and be around because they matter and they will help you grow as a person. 2 high school is new, its scary and can be quite intimidating needing to know what you want to do so you dont fail when you graduate. reality is, as long as you get decent grades it doesnt really matter and theres so much time to learn who you are before committing to a career or field. since graduating ive studied to be an engineer, served as a soldier on counter terrorism plus humanitarian aid and disaster relief, now im working as a scientist trying to solve climate change. this is all in the space of 12 years, so long as you know how you learn, what drives you and where your passions are you can do anything. also little side note, something i learned from working with special forces. theres only one key difference between a special forces soldier and a regular soldier. the special forces soldier will see a new skill, trait or knowledge that they need to do a task and theyll start off terrible at it. doesnt matter how many times they fail, they will practice day and night continuously until they master it. thats all. its also linked to an old musician adage of 100hours of practice makes an amateur but 10000hours of practice makes a professional. you can do whatever you want in life, so long as you know what your passion is and you dont give up. 3 suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. this ones tough, thanks to my military career ive suffered with such severe depression that i was ready to end my life. thankfully i was intercepted by a kind soul who brought me back, now i have a happy family and am loving life. but had i have followed through, none of this would be possible. so believe me when i say it. this too shall pass. these feelings are real, theyre strong, they suck like anything. but, so long as youve got good support and surrounded by kind people you can get through anything. i believe in you, without having even met you, from how youve written this i know you are a smart person who has great potential to go on to do great things. its up to you to follow that potential. 4 there is no objective meaning for crazy, its merely a standard set by society. sure there will be some psyche majors here that will be but the dsm5!. but thats just psychs, they like to quantify things and the mind is so infinitely complex its hard to judge what truly is normal and what is crazy. i noticed that you said youre in a school for difficult children. you are not difficult, you just see things differently to society and need a different education angle to reach your true potential. not trying to shout, but it bugs me to no end seeing the normal or difficult or learning disability phrases thrown around. its not helpful because it makes the person believe theres something inherently wrong with them. theres not, youre just different. from what ive seen, adhd people are generally smarter and can match patterns faster than any normal neurotypical person can. this makes them excellent problem solvers, lateral thinkers and creatives. harnessed properly adhd can be a super power, there are lots of resources out there to do so. 5 life after high school is so much better and so different. high school can be all consuming because its your life 5 days a week. but it does eventually end and life after high school is so much more freeing, interesting and exciting. the kinds of people you can meet, interact with and become friends with is almost limitless. so long as you have an open heart, live a life of kindness and stay open to possibilities you will meet people that youll click with far stronger than anyone in high school. so dont get wrapped up in thinking that these years are so crucial that you cant get them wrong. i was awkward, i was anti social, i once tried to talk to a girl i liked by asking her what her internet speed was. looking back on it, it makes a hilarious story and makes me laugh at how far ive come. some day youll look back and laugh too so dont get too worried about trying to be perfect or to fit in too much.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know exactly what you mean, dont worry you havent offended anyone or at least not me anyway. i just want to convey that when people refer to themselves as normal or more importantly not normal. it tends to put a negative slant on things, its one of the mind traps that can cause negative spirals and circular thinking. best way ive ever heard it described if you have a class full of different animals from the zoo and the test for intelligence was how well each animal could climb a tree. the monkey would succeed and think theyre the best in the world, while the fish will spend the rest of its life thinking its stupid. but, if you put a monkey in the middle of the ocean and try to get it to swim the situation will flip. the reason why i say i believe in you is because reaching out like this, structuring the questions this way and listening to feedback from what is quite an empathetic community is very mature. im not trying to be patronising, but it is a sign of maturity for someone your age. so i do believe there is a spark there, you just need to find your groove and get to know how to make the most of your super powers. so all the best to you and good luck on your future endeavours</data>

  <data key="d1">i agree with talk to a doctor. it can be very difficult as an anxious person to assess things like risk vs. benefit for medications. fwiw which isn't much, as it's just another anecdote, i've personally had a very good experience with antidepressants so far, they've turned down the volume on all the fear, worry and negative thoughts and allowed me to relax and feel good feelings again. they've also made it much easier to work on my problems through cognitive behavioural therapy. i've even had some positive side effects, like sleeping through the night without having to get up to pee, less sensitive tooth pain, and improvements in my sex life. that last one was a real surprise, because of the reputation that they cause sexual problems, but for me they had the opposite effect. i had some negative side effects which weren't very nice, but they've pretty much all worn off now apart from some heartburn issues sometimes. like you said, take your doctor's advice, and speak to a pharmacist if you want to know more about side effects. everything you read on the internet is anecdotes, and will always be biased one way or another. good luck!</data>

  <data key="d1">the internet is really terrible when it comes to any kind of medical advice and discussion. yes some of it is valuable and helpful, but theres a ton of misinformation and anecdotal and biased discussion as well. i hate to say it too, but when youre discussing mental health medications, it helps to remember that many people considering it or that have used it are not in a good place. trust your doctohealthcare provider. they know more and have seen more than your average redditor. i am not saying everything will be perfect and nothing badnegative can ever happen. but if you only read redditinternet comments on this stuff, you will end up with a warped view and terribly terribly afraid. anxiety is only makes it worse. and finally remember, most people dont hang around these kinds of forums once theyre better or if they have uneventful stories. the only people that stick around to vent about them are people that unfortunately had bad experiences. theyre valid of course, but it helps to remember that tens of millions of people use these with minimal side effects. it can be rough. its not an easy choice. but imo it helps know that there is tons of literature demonstrating their safety. adverse effects do happen, but in general, its unlikely to be severe or chronic. i really hate opening a thread on medicine and reading half the comment say no dont do it youll ruin yourself for life its not safe or something like that. you know what else can be debilitating and life ruining? depressionanxiety. never mind that the literature generally doesnt support their claims anyway. again not saying theyre a panacea, but id recommend listening to your doctor first and foremost, and maybe a few medical websites. try to avoid diving too deep into internet forums. youll just scare yourself to pieces.</data>

  <data key="d1">around three or four weeks until i had finished having random weird effects. during that time, though, i still felt overall better for most of the time, just with pockets of weirdness. the side effects were nowhere near as bad as i thought they might be. on the difficulty with overthinking, when i was prescribed the sertraline i was still in a very bad way, and quite unable to make decisions. any time i made a decision i would end up going round in everdecreasing circles of whatif and couldn't do it. i had to say to the doctor i can't make decisions right now, i need your medical recommendation and then i went with that. she was sympathetic as my health anxiety is welldocumented in my records, and she knew i was not doing well at that point!</data>

  <data key="d1">the first step to treating generalized anxiety disorder gad is identifying the symptoms and causes of your anxiety so you can find ways to manage them. you may want to try some of the following techniques set realistic goals for yourself. don't try to do everything at once break down tasks into smaller steps and focus on one at a time. set aside time each day for relaxation exercises such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga. these activities can help lower stress levels while also giving you an outlet for expressing pentup emotions that may have built up over time due to anxiety symptoms like restlessness or irritability. use the school's resources most colleges have great counseling centers where you can go for free counseling and therapy. keep track of what helps. for me, two main things help with my anxiety deep breathing, journaling, taking walks, and coloring. i like to keep track of how many times per week i do each of these things so that if i'm feeling particularly anxious, i can make sure that i get at least one of those things in each day. practice good selfcare habits. eat nutritious foods and drink plenty of water daily exercise regularly take time to relax spend time with friends who bring out the best in you. about making friends, try to volunteer or join clubs. you'll learn more about yourself by helping others out, which will make you feel better about yourself! there are tons of clubs at every college campus join one that interests you most! you never know what kind of people will be involved in these groups until you try them out!</data>

  <data key="d1">i completely understand the feeling. the first thing you have to know is that most likely people either thought you were just handing off the presentation to your colleague, or if they did notice it they too understand the feeling and have forgotten by now. every single person has at least felt nervous at some point during a presentation or they're a psychopath. try with all your might to not avoid. i have firsthand experience that doing so just breeds a deeper phobia. i would say for your next presentation try to be done a day or two in advance and practice what you're going to present first to yourself in the mirror, then to a group of a few people family andor friends but try to set up the environment so that it mimics your presentation environment as well as possible. what helps me is to think simply as myself as the conveyer of the information, does it really make sense to judge the conveyer of the information or the information itself? the information you're speaking is not a reflection of you as a person. when you get back up there next week just try to take some deep breaths beforehand. if you need to take a second to gather your thoughts and leave the room while you're talking, just say you need to go grab some water and come right back, doubt anyone would think anything of that.</data>

  <data key="d1">never punch bare handed. youre asking for messing up your hand and wrist. definitely pad up. 1, 2 punches on a bag continuous while moving your feet up and down for as long as you can gets tough if you dont have breathing with your rhythm. follow your breath. over time, you just focus on your breathing bc if you dont its really hard to move. add in some other type of punches to break up the monotony. this just helps with my cardio and keeping my arms up. if you like it, i recommend joining a boxing group. if theres a spot amateur professional boxers go, those are the best.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi friend, something my therapist told me that shocked me was that i was researching anxiety and coping stuff as a method of coping! like to cope with anxiety i threw myself into research but since i wasnt actually addressing my body or the anxiety happening currently, it wouldnt work. its totally helpful to look up tips breathing mechanisms, grounding techniques, mediation, asmr, etc. but then you have to stop the research and do the things. and it may not help at first but the more you practice these coping skills you read about, the more it works. to really help yourself you have to understand anxiety does not improve in a day and some days you improve and some days are bad days that you cant even do anything but lay there deal, doesnt mean youre not fighting it or your not getting better. you have to be gentle with yourself just like you would a friend. mental health healing is a slow process too theres a lot of ups and downs! i recommend therapy and medication too, but its important to find a therapist that works best for you bc theres a ton out there and some might be awful, some might not help, and some may be your perfect match. i tried therapy twice and almost gave up entirely but then two years after i just felt drawn to call or email this one therapist i saw on psychology today and we just clicked! therapy helps identify triggers, coping techniques, changing thought patterns, and addressing this pressure you place on yourself. if youre not a therapy or medication person i find reddit is super helpful to find resources and also start looking into breathing techniques, mediations, grounding techniques, asmr, affirmations, yoga for anxiety all good things to google and look on youtube! these can be great places to start chose a topic like breathing, do the research and then practice it for a few days or weeks before throwing yourself back into research. remember its a marathon, not a sprint. it will get better but be gentle with yourself just like you would with a loved one.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi willow, thanks so much for the feedback. it really means a lot. my therapist has told me i do try to hard and show some obsessive compulsive traits, without having the disorder. i'm very much a perfectionist and find that i tend to research things really quite deeply before making decisions on things. it's something i'm working on, trying to be kinder to myself and not delve into every little detail of the anxiety. it's almost become my identity the last few months since it started. i will have a chat to my gp about the medication. the sertraline i tried gave me horrible insomnia and i just couldn't push through that. i'm not opposed to medication but do find it hard to accept the bad side effects which make anxietydepression worse. like the advice of treating yourself like you would a friend going through this. need to get that self talk in that way</data>

  <data key="d1">my best tip is to stop trying to stop it and get out of it. instead, say to yourself, my body seems very loud today. that's a sign that i'm feeling very anxious. name it. put the cards on the table. the problem isn't your heart or your lungs or your ears or any of that. the problem is the anxiety. and the reality is that there's no quick fix for that for now, your body will be noisy and you will have anxious thoughts about it, and you have to accept that. because the more you try to stop the anxious thoughts or fight the hypervigilance or stop yourself from concentrating on your breath, the more your anxious brain will perceive that state of hypervigilance as being, itself, a threat, and will ramp it up further. and at the end of the day, it's not a threat, is it? it's no more a threat than when you ride in a rattly old car and you can hear everything rattling and squeaking and banging. it's not a threat. it's annoying. it's tiring. it's frustrating. but that's all. this sort of radical acceptance is at the heart of living with anxiety, i feel. we have to be ok with being anxious and ok with the symptoms of it. we have to reframe it, from being something scary that we must stop, to being something annoying and tiring that we wish would stop, but we don't need to focus on. and if we get good at that, it will, if not stop, at least ease off considerably. our fear of anxiety feeds anxiety, we need to stop feeding it. it's a mind trip but it really does work.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've used both benzos and lyrica. benzos imo are vastly more effective for anxiety but pregabalin is still very effective and i experienced no withdrawal symptoms... everyone is different but i would say try pregabalin before going to benzos.</data>

  <data key="d1">well, as you said most ssris have that stupid side effect that i havent known it was that whats causing the anorgasmia. i dont know about zoloft, i only took it for a year back in 2009 and it was a disaster that made me gain 25kgs in 3 months. anyhow, ive been on prozacfluoxetine for the last 13 years, 90mg per day, it worked wonders compared to zoloft, and id take it 12 hours before sex. it made a huge difference, so in conclusion.. i think you need to ask your doctor which one has the least side effect in terms of this matter, and keep in mind that it varies from one individual to another.. i hope this helps, and i hope you have a healthy life, and that one day you stop needing to take these medicines .. cuz i know, their side effects can sometimes be intolerable. all the best mate.</data>

  <data key="d1">just know youre not alone. shits hard, i feel for you. im battling depression anxiety. its a tough combo. for what its worth, try eating food that boosts the happy brain chemicals, like avocados, chia seed water, stuff like that. you can look it up. also vitamin deficiencies can cause these intense feelings of depression and anxiety. im trying too, its not easy but give it a try. i wish you well! and here if you need an internet friend.</data>

  <data key="d1">here are some supplements that i would research and try. magnesium glycinate will calm your nervous system and doesn't have any severe side effects. 5htp is an amino acid that increases the serotonin in your brain. it does work like an ssri. omege3 fish oil pills reduces blood pressure and reduces inflammation in the brain. tylenol will reduce your anxiety by fifteen percent when it is high and take the edge off. calmaid lavender pills will also reduce your anxiety. you have to take them before a meal the first couple of times or you'll burp up lavender which is really nasty. exercise such as walking will help reduce your anxiety. eat healthy and avoid alcohol, weed, recreation drugs and caffeine.</data>

  <data key="d1">my partner had gad all his life and used to have stomach acid problems. i highly recommend buying the little ginger sugar pills by the ginger people. they help so much especially after a meal, theyll make you burp but youll digest way easier. he never took meds even when a psychiatrist pressured him to, the worst of it for him was age 1822. now hes been anxiety free since his late 20s basically, unless something triggers it. what helped him was a mindfulness and meditation practice, and higher quality cbd. he only takes xanax in oneoff situations like panicking on a plane because it is so addicting. i think coming off the xanax will put you in a better place to address your anxiety naturally, once youre over the initial anxiety wave it causes. have you tried cbt or mindfulness therapy? thats the only thing thats worked for me during severe bouts of anxiety. also if you have general fear i highly recommend the book fear by thich nhat hanh. it helped me so much with my fear of accidents, flying, and sudden death. its the ultimate guide to being a human with fear! once you are off the meds ask your psychiatrist or doctor about ltheanine, an amino acid they isolate from green tea that is calming and takes away jitters. it has also helped me enormously on tough days.</data>

  <data key="d1">ive been working with a doctor of physical therapy who also does some metaphysical healing and he is helping me regulate my nervous system. i was cynical and flat out refused to see him for at least a year a friend had been recommending him. im shocked at the real improvements ive experienced. im off meds for the first time in about a decade and somehow its not a total train wreck. previously i was on cymbalta, wellbutrin, adderal, and xanax. my extreme pain is improving but more importantly im not living with that constant sickness of fear in my belly and chest which started when i was like age 5 im 39 now. im even planning a trip out of the country without my husband which would have been an impossible prospect even a couple months ago. the doc is located in michigan but he also has some free videos on his site, and also does virtual appointments. feel free to message me if youre interested in his info. im not trying to be pushy or advertise anything. i feel for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">magnesium glycinate can cause diarrhea until your body gets used to it but it shouldn't make you nauseous. there are a bunch of nerves right below your sterum or right below the v at the bottom of your rib cage. these nerves come together right on top of your stomach. that's why when you get really your stomach because nauseous. you should be able to rub that area and get some relief. your need to calm you sympathetic nervous system. yoga will calm your sympathetic nervous system. yoga, meditation, exercise all help to calm your sympathetic nervous system down. your wound up like a clock and you need to release that nervous energy.</data>

  <data key="d1">dizziness started in mid november, went to canberra on the 10th of december and i had my first near faint experience followed by high heart beat and palpitation. dizziness and lightheaded was followed till the 28th of december when i nearly fainted again and had really high heart rate went to hospital. they did blood work and ecg couldnt find a probable cause. went to hospital again 3 days later and no findings were evident. upon my 3rd visit to hospital xray was done of my chest and nothing was found. symptoms lightheaded dizziness heart gets tired quickly especially after a episode sometimes my arms and hands become a little numb. my head feels tension. brain fog a episode causes heat in my abdomen, back and my ears get hot. feels like a pulsating feeling through my body during a bad episode sometimes left shoulder feels warm my eyes sometimes drop tears randomly unable to concentrate at times shortness of breath during episode theres always a tense feeling in my chest and around my heart area. sometimes hits my lower abdomen and i feel nausea makes my stomach make noises. i have difficulty sleeping my head spins more when i close my eyes. i wake up between 13am with a weird feeling as if im scared or something. vision sometimes becomes blurry. fatigue and tiredness. little sudden noises scare me. whenever i have a episode that peaks, my hands and feet get sweaty and i feel heat. my hands and feet sometimes get cold. the feeling in my mid left chest area i cant explain but its as if my muscles are vibrating. when i stand up its seems my head and chest symptoms get worse for about a minute and then settle down. same thing happens when i lay down. it gets worse for a minute till it goes back to how it was. sometimes i can feel it hitting my front part of my head and my sinus feels tense as well. as well as my ears feel the pressure. lying down seems to reduce some tension in my head. i feel bad 80 of the day really bad 15 of the day and alright 5 of the day. 23012022 arms are hot, face is hot, ears are feeling hot, eyes are tearing, tension in head. heat in abdomen and back. hands are cold, feet are cold. 2 hours to stabilise health report for dr i believe my anxiety is chronic, its been with me since a young age i just didnt realise until it became severe. i do worry about everyday situation too much when i think about it now and believe things that arent even real. i got sick around november, one day i just woke up and i was dizzy and brain foggy. it was persistent and didnt go away, over the next month it got worse until i got to a point i couldnt breath and got hospitalised. all tests came back negative and they sent me home. this was a on going cycle 6 times in and out of hospital, nothing was helping. so i went to my gp and she said its most likely anxiety. after this point i think i broke the anxiety inducing cycle. even though my worries and trauma are past the physical symptoms are still here or at least in my subconscious. my trauma last year was my business got burnt down by our competition and my now wife which was a fianc back at the same time the store burnt in which i had trust issues with. my parents had told me shes probably using me to gain citizenship etc, so i was always worried about this and thought she might not love me. so i believe these 2 events were too great for me. lets go back to my childhood, my earliest memory is probably when i was around 10. if i would focus on my breathing it felt like i couldnt breath anymore. i also had these unexplained spinning and dizziness at a young age during sleep time. doctors couldnt find anything. i was always a scared kid thinking about the worse case scenario that might kill me but in reality it was overthinking. in highschool a few times i nearly fainted out of the blue. sometimes during sports ill hit a point where out of no where my heart would start racing and my breathing would become laboured. sometimes over excitement caused this as well. now medications lexapro 20mg 6 weeks, reduce symptoms by about 40. chronic dizziness subsided by 80 that woozy feeling. we also tried zoloft 50mg for 3 weeks than 100mg for 3 days. i think zoloft worked better but i had a massive attack on it on day 3 of 100mg. while i was driving i started to lose my mind and my whole body went on fire as if someone poured petrol on me and lit me and i was itchy for a week or 2 after. so dr esin tapered me off and put me back on lexapro and also prescribed me pristiq and said book a appointment with your phyc doctor asap. im not taking the pristiq yet. she told me either we can continue trying different medicine or you can prescribe a medicine on top of the ssri, also said continue on lexapro and ask dr raiz if i should try a snri or buspar. i was also prescribed cbd oil. i take that 2 times a day, i also have thc incase i have a attack which would calm me down apparently and she also prescribed me valium incase. so far in the 6 months since my illness began ive had 1 full blown attack. if anxiety had a scale and the attack is 1010, my persistent anxiety is always 247 between 4510, so its pretty much chronic at this point. i took valium for 2 days for the tapering off period but it doesnt seem to do anything? i assuming the affect is felt greater when youre having a attack or high anxiety periods. havent had any psychotic episodes since i had the 2 last time i told you which is good. im 50 back to work. trying to keep my mind clear and i am going to gym 3 times a week with my wife. but i believe i need more support and more reassurances that it is anxiety that is affecting me. symptoms dizziness burning tongue headache nausea metallic taste in mouth hot flushes fatigue numbness in hands pins and needles brain fog startled easily blood pressure problems heart feeling heavy fast heart beat feel like im dying losing my mind losing control very negative thoughts intrusive thoughts hyper reactive blurry vision cold palms and feet sweaty palms and feet hot flushes feeling sick flu like psychotic episode weak limbs digestion problems numbness nightmares and many more its wide spread though now i think i might be getting better or the medicine is helping. i couldnt even go outside when i first came to you, i would feel like fainting all the time. now its a rare occurrence but the other symptoms are persistent and always there. for example if i go to a shopping centre my brain becomes foggy again. i dont have to think or feel anything it just happens in my subconscious. i think i tolerate the medications pretty well and they all have some degree of effect, but its not enough for me. for example my sleep has drastically improved. for the last 2 years i wouldnt be able to sleep more then 4 hours now i have trouble waking up in the morning which is a good thing. i sleep a solid 68 hours which is a good improvement. i also tried the cannabis thc once and it made me feel relieved for the first time in 6 months i felt my muscles all loosen up. i felt the anxiety trying to hit me within though like as if thc put it in a cage and it was trying to get out. so obviously it doesnt fix the problem but masks it. medications ive tried lexapro 40mg seroquel 12.5mg pregablin 25mg</data>

  <data key="d1">had this since covid for 2 years now. it's happened in several stages and tends to cycle randomly. here's what i've been doing.. i make sure i'm exhaling all the way. i don't. i think i am but the automatic function seems to be wonky so i have to really focus on getting enough air out every minute or so. i'm tensing my upper body to force enough out. if i do not do this, the breaths get too shallow, the chest gets so achy from overinflating trying to get the deep breath, and my constant vertigo kicks up. next i make sure i'm not only breathing from the chest. laying on the floor my back i observe movement. if the diaphragm ain't pulling its weight i wont have movement in the abdomen. that's no good. i sing pushing against the diaphragm with a balled up fist and hold some note or read aloud to get it responding. i used to be a vocalist now my tone is weak and wobbly. i make sure my nose is clear. my nose feels constantly pinched, air doesnt register right going through it yet it doesnt seem congested. i've tried netty pots and sprays but grossly i just have to pick at it to really clear it because its like my snots different. once i get it out of there and i try flaring the nostrils a few times i can feel a numbness to it still. the mucus keeps doing the same thing over and over despite antihistamines. i feel like my epiglottis lil flappy thing is half closed or caked in my weird too sticky saliva problem and that makes it feel like i am breathing through a wet rag. constantly clearing the throat of gunk day and night. to combat this i'm hyper focused on my neck and posture. chin to chest neck stretches. looking for any advice on the swallowing or yawningair choking if anyone has any.</data>

  <data key="d1">im not a doctor, if you want a tldr most of these are anxiety but you should see a doctor as they could suggest solutions to these. weird dreams are normal for everyone, specific stressful events can cause specifically stressful dreams. if this happens constantly medication or diet change could help so speak with a physician. also false awakenings usually happen because on is stressed or constantly thinking about the state of dreaming, people who attempt to lucid dreams will have false awakenings because theyre partially aware of their dreaming state sleep paralysis can also be a symptom of an anxiety or sleep disorder. changing the position in which you sleep or medication could also fix this, again consult your physician. most people experience dj vu to some degree, if youre seriously considered about it speak to your physician but id assume your anxiety is causing you to focus on it more. overall, all of the symptoms youve described could be symptoms of anxiety, though, they could also be a symptom of another problem. consulting a physician to possibly diagnose or find a way to aid these problems and restore you quality of living is crucial. hope the future is better to you.</data>

  <data key="d1">i had my first sp experience when my anxiety cranked up this year. i'm kind of glad. it's something i've always been very afraid of. i refuse to sleep on my back because it's more likely to cause sp. even though my experience was terrifying, it wasn't as bad as i built it up to be in my head so i'm not worried about it anymore. as far as nightmares i've been having them every night lately. they aren't all horrible, but i haven't had a pleasant dream in months.</data>

  <data key="d1">ive been having this problem every day now, ive been looking for help as well. everytime i dream i have sleep paralysis or false awakenings. ive seen my doppleganger as well. ive managed to be able to control my dreams bc during them i realized they are my mind. i literally just woke up from a dream where i was in sleep paralysis, i woke up in a dream and then had sleep paralysis again and i immedietely jumped on reddit for help or anything related to this i know i cant be the only one. it feels like im going insane. i have severe depression and really bad anxiety, im also an addict and i cant help but wonder if my brain is just strong or did i somehow damage it? could this kill me? sometimes i feel like im dying i dont know but im also very young too. please let me know anything and if you can message me i would love to discuss this. these have to be more than weird dreams</data>

  <data key="d1">i am terrified of sleeping! i truly have no clue whats happening. and i have no idea where to start so ima just start with the process of going to bed. when im laying down i can sometimes tell when these weird trance dreams are gonna happen. i usually get dizzy and jt feels like waves on my brain and its super hard to move and my eyes are extremely heavy. and when i do shift into these types of dreams they are usually horrible dreams that make me wanna wake up. when i try waking up i cant, unless i violently shake myself and that doesnt work the first time, i usually just wake up in my bed thinking i have woken up and some fucked up shit like me collapsing to ground due to lack of oxygen makes me realize i didnt actually wake up. i once again then violent shake myself awake. but then once i have woken up i cant even stay awake because my eyes are so heavy they start closing on there own.</data>

  <data key="d1">divide your age in half. round up. so in your case, 16. them add 7. which in your case makes 23. that means that 23 is the absolute youngest you should even consider. which is still an 8 year age gap so you really have to make sure you're at the same stage in your lives. i'm sorry that you're experiencing so much distress but understand that 19 is barely an adult. she won't be able to legally drink for 2 more years, and you've been over 21 for 10 years. at best she would quickly outgrow the relationship and at worst you're a pedo and a groomer</data>

  <data key="d1">last night my anxiety was playing up to the point i was convinced i had food poisoning which is what i was anxious about so, kinda ironic my physical symptoms were so convincing tho. butterflies to the extent that it felt like there was hot lava churning inside me, elevated temperature and my legs were shaking uncontrollably. i was sure it was food poisoning. after 3 hours and realising i would be dying at this point if it was food poisoning, my symptoms pretty much fled. i cannot believe how convincing this illness is, no matter how much you try to flood yourself with more rational thoughts. it's honestly like your brain is working against you</data>

  <data key="d1">anxiety is often rational. maybe not in the way you and many in this sub generally see it, but it's a rational human response in many situations. anxiety is a good and rational response when a human is threatened. someone begins following you on a dark street at night. anxiety is what primes the body to the potential for problem and prompts the flight or flight response. standing on the edge of a high height where one could fall to their death, anxiety is what again alerts us to the potential for harm and potential responses to save the body from harm. in these cases, and many others, anxiety is a rational and proper human response designed to protect us.</data>

  <data key="d1">i understand what you are saying but in this case it isnt helping me with a real problem. oftentimes anxiety comes with this kind of panic about things that arent happening or that i blow out of proportion. i experience terror despite evidence that it isnt true. my mind has developed coping techniques due to trauma and now i respond to minor worries as a crisis. the reason i seek medical support and therapy is because its a mental illness, not a helpful tool for survival. i am grateful for the anxiety that protects me, not the anxiety that actively harms me.</data>

  <data key="d1">i didnt read you post. but, i am gonna say this anyways. there are plenty of times that anxiety is rational. im not pointing you out. ive dealt with anxiety since i was a child. hell, i have some while typing this right now. we need to stop this misconception and blanket theory that all anxiety is bad. anxiety is a primal biological emotion. it helps us survive as a species. if someone serves into your lane, your amygdala is gonna act and tell you to make a move to save your life. your heart is gonna best into your throat. thats called anxiety and it can and will save your life. so the bit that anxiety is never rational thats just not true. listen, im not a psychologist. ive done plenty of therapy and psychology though. maybe talk to a therapist, but i think its unhealthy to look at all anxiety as irrational. even my therapist gives me tools to work anxiety and make it into something useful. just a thought. downvote me to hell if you need to, but we need to stop addressing this incorrectly. edit i should have added this in the second paragraph. there is plenty of anxiety that comes from the amygdala. this is a primal part of our brain. the reason we think that anxiety is irrational, is because when that happens, that part of the brain sends a signal and the body reacts. this doesnt even need to include the prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain responsible for reasoning. meaning, in the moment, this anxiety is not going to make sense to you and you arent going to be able to just solve whats going on. this is why therapy is so important for people who suffer from anxiety. its not as simple as anxiety is irrational. i encourage to research the neurology behind these emotions. it will provide a lot of good information.</data>

  <data key="d1">idk, you may need to really think about things in your life. my anxiety is that like horrible things are gonna happen. like i'm gonna die. if u get pregnant, that's really something you can deal with. my fears are irrational and feel real even though they are not but at least what i'm afraid of is like really scary. you shouldn't really be worried about getting pregnant. you know. your thinking seems off more than just a fear response.</data>

  <data key="d1">ive been through this too! i bought a handful of 1 pregnancy tests and took all of them and feel so silly looking back. your birth control works. i know this may not help you, but it did help me, to just hear people assure me that i wasnt. you arent pregnant. your brain is taking a regular experience and twisting it. try to think back on other things you scared yourself about in the past that turned out fine you may try to convince yourself that this times different but its just not. i hope you feel better soon. take care of yourself.</data>

  <data key="d1">ooo boy. i'm sorry. you already know that grief comes in waves and the pain will happen less often with time. my best advice is to make a list of memories and cute little behaviors your pet had. if you can afford to bring a new pet into your family, the unconditional love really does help. some people worry this is like trying to replace the pet that passed away, and some people feel too much pain to have space for a new pet right away. either way, sending you support. so sorry for what you are going through.</data>

  <data key="d1">my best advice is switch him to a raw food diet something like the brand primal nuggets and get a solid cbd tincture. this stuff can be reversed sometimes. with his age it can at least give you longer than without a change. cats need to eat their species appropriate diets which a lot of times people just dont consider because theyve never done the research or have been educated. i wish you both the best and i hope he stays around for as long as possible, outdoing his expectancy by far. maybe get a pet stroller and give him access to sunlight more, and directly. all mammals need it.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think it's a great suggestion, but given the premise i'd be careful still. i'd be sure to try open communication. voice your emotions, your concerns, and find a compromise. you can ask if it'd be okay to do so, or that you would like to to so, and ask her to try. getting messages can be burdensome too, if in a bad mindset. it'd really help if she shared her concerns and thoughts too. why does she feel like she needs distance from you? either way, if the premise is clear, and sending a 'thinking of you' without reply expectation, i think that would be nice gestures. she can read them and put them aside, or see the notification aside, and check back on it when she feels like it.</data>

  <data key="d1">i actually have a lot of experience with this! for some reason, my hearthealthrelated anxiety started manifesting as a fear of sudden adult onset nut allergies. which, logically, makes no sense because i've never had a nut allergy. my therapist described it as a growing scope of triggers. so when my anxiety was unmanaged, it grew to encompass things that hadn't ever worried me before. the best way to treat it is exposures the more you eat the things you are worried about, and see that there is no reaction, the less you'll worry about it. personally, i also found it helpful to be aware of the signs and symptoms of a reaction tingling mouth, rashes on arms and stomach, etc. just to reassure myself that the food wasn't hurting me. hope this helps!</data>

  <data key="d1">panic attacks typically happen for no reason. anxiety attacks happen because of a trigger. people with anxiety tend to have both. i had an anxiety attack in school a few months ago and i felt really stupid afterwards. but it really doesnt have to do with intelligence. anxious people have more worries than people without anxiety, and so we have a more difficult time coping with stress. it can build up and cause anxiety attacks.</data>

  <data key="d1">firstly take it easy and slow down a bit. the more actual information you have gathered the better! dont give any time or effort to what if or maybe that thoughts, gather up info and have it ready. it sounds like a migraine, i am sorry to say, they are awful. when i get them i am light, sound, and motion sensitive and basically stuck in a dark room laying down feeling like i am going to vomit for at least 24 hours. all i can do is try and rest it off. drink enough water so your urine is pretty much clear, if you dont have a blood pressure cuff get one if you can and take regular readings, write stuff down and track how you are feeling. if stuff improves or not, just telling a doctor ive had a bad headache for three days doesnt help as much as being able to say, i have had a bad headache for three days, i have slept x amount, i amam not eating normally, i have been recoding blood pressure heres the log, i was givenhave taken these medications. have you tried anything for allergy relief? does it hurt when you chew or open your jaw or speak? is one side of your jaw more tender than the other? are you getting any cracks or pops or grinding? i have been dealing with gnarly tmj issues for the past 8 months and at first it seemed like a terrible sinus infection that wouldnt go away, now i know and am working with my doctorsdentists on that issue.</data>

  <data key="d1">ok, so it's pretty weird to try mirtazipine as a first med. it's usually something they try if the normal ssri drugs aren't working or have terrible side effects. unfortunately, extreme fatigue is normal with mirtazipine, at least in my experience. i took it for about 2 years a long time ago, and i remember being incredibly fatigued in the morning for at least 4 or 5 hours. but it did get better, and after the first year i remember the fatigue had completely disappeared. the weirdest thing was that i was taking one pill a day, but if i broke that pill in half and took that, the effect was much stronger. like twice the effect from half the amount. it's a very strange drug. i do remember the fatigue was reliably the same time after taking the pill, so i could change when the fatigue set in by varying the time i took the pill. but it knocked me out right away so i couldn't really take it before 8pm.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey i think the last few years have been hard on everyone. i feel if you can do stuff to prepare yourself and help yourself. could be stocking food, medical supplies. growing a veggie garden, keeping seeds. buy from farmers markets. meet groups with similar interest. right now im not in a good mental head space.. so i havent really been involved. but here they have a group that if shit hit the fan we have each others backs or can swap stuff we grow. good locks, cameras and screens on your doors. just small things to put your mind at ease.. gardening is also amazing. even if its in pots. things are crazy there but they are also crazy all around the world. all i know is we cant prevent it just ourselves but we can help prepare ourselves in small ways. community is important.</data>

  <data key="d1">prime example, i think? surely it's not my side doing anything wrong, it's the other. you are no help here. but for op, if you see a lot of it on reddit especially, step away from it for awhile. if friends talk about it, ask to change the subject. turn off the news. spend more time working on a hobby or finding new ones. worry about your own well being until you are mentally prepared to take on worrying for others, it's an insanely exhausting task. most of what is going on is out of any one persons control, but if you do talk about itget involved, just remember to be the change you want to see. don't take differing opinions to heart and don't let it frustrate you. just worry about your own quality of life and how to improve it and things will get better.</data>

  <data key="d1">my friend, it is indeed true that times are undeniably changing. choices are being made for us that are well out of our control and as we see the mayhem and the lies and the controversy wash over us like a boiling pot of water, what are we to do? things outside of our control are just that, the only thing we can expect of ourselves is to take each day as it comes, adapt to the changes and just survive. that's all we can do is survive and you can do it. you can make it through, we all can. the weight of the world seems so heavy to just one man's shoulders but when you take into account its not only your shoulders but millions of others as well perhaps the load begins to become more bearable, a little lighter. just breath, ready yourself for a new day, enjoy the one you are in and expect change and be willing to move with the times. i promise you such turmoil cannot last forever and you will make it through. you are stronger than you think and you just need time and rest to forget about the bigger picture and focus only on yourself and your family. never forgetting, you are not alone. may peace find you, my friend and may your anxiety give way so that you can achieve the rest i know you are in dire need of.</data>

  <data key="d1">i can't relate to driving to the hospital when i feel like having an anxiety attack, mostly because i need to be at home or go somewhere remote to not panic but i definitely feel you. i hate my anxiety and i just wish it would go away. i'm trying to find a therapist atm but it's a long process and my anxiety kinda gets in the way of me being able to actively look for help. such irony... yoga and meditation kind of helps, also the medication i take helps most of the time but today i had a really bad day and felt horrible. sorry for the rant. what i'm trying to say is you're definitely not alone with your feelings. i wish you all the best!</data>

  <data key="d1">i can absolutely relate to this to the point where i feel compelled to reply. ive always had difficulties with movies that have troubled me, scared me, left me unable to sleep ever since i was young. i just dont get how people can watch scary movies for entertainment but i understand that some just arent affected the way i am. the movie you watched is a really traumatic story but its also compelling as it confronts us with something we want to ignore and hope wont happen. ive had spells in my life where ive worried about exactly the things youre describing. ive got through by taking comfort in being around friends and family, enjoying nature and keeping my entertainment choices light and as fun as possible. watch a good movie thats funny and upbeat to try and lift your mood. anxiety is bad enough without fuelling it with things that scare us.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, i know im a little late but just wanted to say your not alone. in january i fainted twice while intoxicated and was certain i was about to die. all i could think about in that moment was my loved ones, and that i would never get to tell them i love them again. the weeks following that, my health anxiety broke free. even though i was completely healthy, i was petrified i was on the verge of death. i had constant panic attacks, and at one point went 4 days straight without sleeping because i was certain i had sleep apnea that was going to kill me in my sleep. because of this i ended up getting my mum to take me to ae one night, where i got my bloods taken, chest x rayed and everything screened. the results once again showed i was fine but i just couldnt believe it. i then went to my gp and she put me on an ssri, but it didnt help me, it actually made me worse and at this point i was fully suicidal. after 6 weeks of constant panic and dread i was exhausted and just wanted it to end. i just wanted to feel safe again. i was so ready to give in. but my family kept me safe and convinced me to go back to the gp and try a different anti anxiety med im in the uk so i was put on mirtazapine us name is remeron and it has changed my life. i no longer want to die. i no longer have constant panic attacks. its a slight sedative, so i take it just before bed and sleep 8 hours a night. i just wanted to share that because i want you to know that you are not alone, but you are also not doomed. i know this sounds like bullshit but you have the strength to do this, and i believe in you. you are loved, even by a random reddit person, and you will be okay one day!</data>

  <data key="d1">its a benzodiazepine so the longer you take it the more your brain will adjust to it and thus you will need more to achieve the same effect. they can be great to help with anxiety when it gets bad, but not necessarily a long term solution. talk to your doctor about it and also talk about the possibility of trying an ssri if you havent already.</data>

  <data key="d1">i got a prescription for 15 1mg lorazepamgeneric ativan pills and only used the benzos when my anxiety was at its worst. it took me 3 and a half weeks to use it all and i didn't get addicted. just don't use it regularly and for longer than a few weeks at that regular interval and you'll be okay. it's definitely a very shortterm solution until you find a good antidepressant. my next antianxiety med i'm gonna try is buspirone. i'm super sensitive to side effects so cymbalta almost killed me for about 5 days on one dose, and bupropion gave me dizziness and intense chest pain that sent me to the er after only 3 pills. apparently buspirone has basically zero withdrawal symptoms, low side effects, and relatively decent antianxiety effects from what i've read. so that's what i wanna try next to help reduce my anxiety since i'm apparently really damn sensitive.</data>

  <data key="d1">been dealing with panic attacks since 2012, just for a bit of backgroundexperience, i have been on upwards of 7 meds at once. generally, it varies persontoperson. anyone can become addicted. the best way to avoid it, is to take it only when you actually need it. you know you're addicted, when you pop one out of boredom. behavioral therapy works great for most. for example, i got over my fear of heights by skydiving. the point is, look for what causes the anxiety, then do not avoid it.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah, that's my move for buspirone! it's specifically only an antianxiety med. it's not an antidepressant with antianxiety effects. so it doesn't fuck with you nearly as hard. i would just take your lorazepam when needed. just don't take it regularly because 60 pills one a day would definitely cause a dependency issue. so whenever your anxiety symptoms are feeling terrible, i would then take a lorazepam just to get relief. if you take them nonregularly and only when needed you shouldn't get addicted. try and stretch those pills over the course of a few months, and if you don't need them, just don't take them! they have a long shelflife so they can sit on your shelf for aquite some time waiting for you to have a rough day.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know this post is old but a i hope youre doing ok and b yes ativan lorazepam or any benzo can become addictive. it may not always become addictive mentally but it can become addictive physically. i suffer from severe panic attacks along with difficulty leaving my house. i have been on ativan for 9 years. it started with .5 mg just 5 tablets a month for as needed. 9 years later its 1 mg tablets 3 times a day. so i get 90 a month. as someone who was addicted to pain pills for 15 years i know what mental addiction is and i dont have that with ativan. but to some extent i could have a physical dependency to it??? i suppose if i abused it and ran out of it before my next refill i am assuming i would go through physical withdrawals. i dont crave ativan the way i did opiates. ive always used it the way ive been told but it doesnt mean we cant physically become dependent on it without even knowing. i really hope i am making sense! as someone who has been on it for almost 10 years i will say i agree that it is not a longterm solution. that being said its a little scary at the idea of going off of it knowing how much it has helped me over the years. i suppose like anything in life there is good and bad with something</data>

  <data key="d1">yes, i used to take xanax like crazy for my anxiety and constant panic. when i realized i was abusing it, i stopped. i kept an old bottle around in case i had a really really bad panic attack. when i did end up taking it for a bad one, i felt more anxious and depressed after. i also thought it was a fluke so i took it again the next day because i felt on the edge and it happened again but worse which was the opposite of what it was supposed to do. it also made it harder for me to handle anxiety and panic for a few days following. i always rolled my eyes at my doctors who told me to stay active, eat right, and meditate, but those have been the 3 best longterm treatments for mine.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi. i'm a 21f and i moved to a different province the first time i went to university. take a big breath. i know it's scary to move far away and basically start a new life. know that you can always call, facetime and visit back home. it is not a goodbye forever. university will be hard. if you're used to getting high grades in high school, that will probably change. but, you will manage. you will find your own bag of tricks to get through the really busy times and somehow, you will get through each assignment. if things start getting difficult, turn to the loads of resources that are provided. i should have used the resources more than i did. you will make lots of friends. although it may seem like everyone has their shit together, you're all actually in the same boat, struggling to get through the adjustment of university. that creates a bond, at least it did for me. and university is a much bigger place compared to high school. there are all sorts of people. you will find your group. i was so scared and i was embarrassed of that. looking back, i should have told someone, a friend or family member. it's so normal to be afraid of the unknown.</data>

  <data key="d1">well for starters id like to ask if your parents set high standards for you at a young age because this could play a big part in that. the best thing that you can do is to start forming positive self talk, teach yourself new habits and that its okay to be average at some things or 2nd best. being competitive is not a bad thing but when it interferes with your mental wellbeing and future then it is a problem. you should maybe open up to someone about this that you can trust. just know that you are stronger than you think and dont be so hard on yourself, youre only human and its okay to make mistakes. use the competitiveness in a positive way for sports or video games maybe. things that you find fun and wont take so seriously. you dont have to be exceptional you just have to be you. i think that youre very very young to be having these high expectations for yourself that are unrealistic. set small goals for yourself and im sure that you will feel somewhat fulfilledsatisfied with results even if they are small. your life is far more important than a test score or a trophy. whenever you feel those really bad thoughts you should write a letter to yourself and read it in the morning and ask yourself if you feel the same. your life is just as important as anyone elses and im sure your family would be greatly devastated. so please speak to an adult you can trust or a school counselor.</data>

  <data key="d1">you sound homesick which is a completely normal thing to be for anyone away from home for the first time. even people who are extremely social and outgoing can and do feel the same way in private. sometimes the homesickness passes and eventually you adapt and become more independent. other times you discover that being so far from family is not for you, i used to visit home on the weekends because that's just the level i was comfortable with, and as an adult know that i want to live in the same state as my family. while i have friends who are fine living across the country from family and seeing them once a year. it's just not for me. you've only been there for a couple of days, these are the hardest days. it's so new and a huge drastic change takes time to get used to. it's perfectly normal to struggle and be freaked out and sad. dont be so hard on yourself. some people even go on a temporary anxietydepression med to get them through big changes until they adapt. it's really common.</data>

  <data key="d1">that is entirely up to you. i can understand that you're worried you're not going want to go back. you probably won't want to, it will be hard. but if you do go to visit and are scared of going back to uni just remember that it's not forever and you can and will come home again. if you feel the urge will be too strong and you'll want to stop going to school then postpone the visit a bit, maybe stay at uni for a month to really get used to it. and even then when you visit home you'll be sad to leave your family and miss them, you love them and they love you, it's hard to be away from those we love. that love won't change even with the distance. they say it takes at least 30 days to make something new a habit, exercise, sleep routines, even jobs. give it some time, visit home when you feel you need to, but really give staying at uni a chance. when i'm struggling i say to myself one more day, i can do anything for just one more day and then i keep going. talk to your family often and if you're comfortable tell them about your homesickness, if you're worried about being too emotional on the phone then put it in a text or email. maybe sharing those feelings will take some pressure off, and remember that almost every student away from home is having the same struggles you are. everyone is different in how they like it in the end, you may struggle though this semester or year and decide to go to a uni closer to home, that's totally fine. you may decide that you can manage after all and decide to keep going. the urge to quit is the strongest right at the start, i hated being away in the beginning, i did eventually get used to it and was able to function and have fun and laugh. but i still cherished my time with my family and wished i was home sometimes.</data>

  <data key="d1">sounds like you're a little bit in awe of her being 'super cool' and that's why you're self conscious. problem is, if you tell her this, she'll feel awkward too! one possible way around it is to take back a little bit of control and 'invite' her to a home cooked dinner and a bottle or two of wine so you can relax and get to know her better. if you can't cook ask her what's her favourite movie and get a pizza delivered, anything to get under the superficiality barrier. once you break the ice she'll become more human and you'll relax around her.</data>

  <data key="d1">its that fact that i dont know what to expect. plus, its a large group of people around. it just makes it a bit unnerving for me. so, it might be because im not used to doing events like this, and its not me avoiding them, its not doing them lots due to other things that life brings my way.</data>

  <data key="d1">so you're not used to them then? in that case i don't see any other option then just force yourself to do it despite anxiety. it would get a lot better afterwards, only at the beginning it should be this bad. but that may not be possible if your anxiety is really so high.</data>

  <data key="d1">overall, definitely still some anxiety but much better than before. i've still been trying to keep up with exercise and meditation but it's been difficult this summer. i will say that i feel a little dulled emotionally at times though, but not so much that i'm cold and heartless or anything. personally, i try to go to the gym 4 days a week. i just do some weight lifting and a little cardio. i also try to do 30 minutes of yoga once in a while too. i'm in the same boat with an office job and i think just getting active in some way makes a difference.</data>

  <data key="d1">i get you! i tried medication and it did nothing i have panic attacks and anxiety. it made it worse actually and my psychologist said that pills are not for mei tried 2 or 3. just to keep healthy lifestyle meditation, journal, working out. it's not completly gone but it's better because i couldn't get on the pills it got worse for me if i even thought about pills it give me so much anxiety that i will get addicted to them. my doctor said that if i'm feeling an attack take two breaths inhale and one big breath out exhale do that about 35 times. it's 90 better. because it tricks a brain or something like that. if pills are making it worse or it's the same they will not work at least it didn't for me i suggest you try some more other stuff,medication route should really be last fix. try also this meditaton on youtube challenge 30 days by iris dailey. keep us updated! xo</data>

  <data key="d1">medication is a personal choice that you can always abandon if not for you. medication only for anxiety,like benzos, are not for long use as they are addictive. some ssris are preferred instead. anxiety is managed by learning to address the symptoms and patterns you have. therapy, meditation, etc are necessary. for me meds deal more with the physical effects and allow time to focus on making changes</data>

  <data key="d1">besides the obvious advice to start meditating, walking in nature, getting enough sleep, etc to heal your mind and body, i would also advice to go to the doc and ask for a referral to a cardiologist. with some simple tests heart echo ecg holter monitor they can check the health of your heart. if it comes back fine, then maybe you are able to put it to rest. at least you'll have something to fall back on. good luck my friend. anxiety sucks.</data>

  <data key="d1">i cant tell you if you will feel like your old self again. but you will feel like a new self. is that better or worse? that depends on you. if you do the work then you may be better in time. with that i mean finding a way to reduce anxiety in a way that works for you and is healthy. what works for me is this. exercise resistance training and going for long walks. nutrition reduce sugar and keep away from processed food. not always but mostly. socialize it helps my depression and anxiety both. meditation not for everyone watching for negative thinking patterns hard to do sometimes. sleep get enough, meaning more than 9 hours of bet time. 68 is enough is bullshit. very few people can get away with less than 8 hours of sleep. i also mean 8 hours of sleep, not 8 hours counting after i lay down. and other small stuff. this works for me, and may not for you. you need to try stuff out and find what works for you. but you need to actively do the things. you cannot be passive about it. also a word of caution with medication. medication is a strong tool, but they arent to be taken for a long time. they are to be used to make it easier to find stuff that works and to suppress symptoms. they dont fix the underlying issues. nonetheless, for some they are a powerful tool that helps. i would suggest finding a good therapist as well. for me cbt worked well. i learned a lot about myself and techniques that helped. hope it helps. youre not alone, a lot of people experience this. and it can get better.</data>

  <data key="d1">anxiety symptoms are always changing and evolving dependent on how worse or better the anxiety gets. i now deal with symptoms that scare the hell out of me that ive never had before, so much so that im going to get and mri. but let me tell you it is wayyyy more than likely to be your anxiety than it is to be a heart attack. with that being said doctors are notorious for misdiagnosing and missing things that are actually happening however, if youve gone to the er 3 separate times and each time has came back clear it isnt your heart. trust me when i say that if something was terribly wrong it would most definitely show up on a test. it sounds just very basically like health anxiety, we hyper fixate on symptoms, research our symptoms, fall down the hole that tells us everything is an emergency, and then make ourselves believe its happening to us. the biggest takeaway here is knowing and trusting if something was an emergency and something terrible like a heart attack was happening it would show up on a test and not go unnoticed. anxiety causes severe chest pains, shortness of breath, nausea, and pain. the best remedy here is honestly doing your very best to find some relaxation techniques. reduce caffeine intake so your heart isnt fluttery or palps or racing, and take deep breaths to bring everything back. if you can get your breath and thoughts under control, or at least your breath your heart should feel better. the less you pay attention to it, the less the symptoms will be noticeable. the more you pay attention to it the more it will be noticeable and youll panic about it. use distractions as much as you possibly can. if the symptoms continue or get worse then i would suggest going to your doctor to discuss this unless its very severe you need to go to the er. if you notice burning sensations like heart burn, cold sweats or excessive sweating, ringing in your ears, extreme pressure literally like someone is sitting on your chest then that would be an er trip definitely.</data>

  <data key="d1">i struggle with something similar when i'm anxious, my anxiety usually manifests itself in my body. i start to feel physically sick my common symptoms are nausea, achy joints, shakiness and cold sweats. it's usually not that bad, unless i have to drive in an unfamiliar andor hectic place. if i know i'm going to be driving somewhere unfamiliar, my anticipatory anxiety kicks in and i start to feel sick, like i described. i'm not sure why driving makes me so anxious.. i'm working with my therapist to get to the root of it. for the time being, breathing exercises and positive self talk have been somewhat helpful.. but it's so frustrating though, because even if i look at maps ahead of time and mentally get to a point where i know drive won't be that difficult or scary,everytime, i start to feel sick when i anticipate driving somewhere new regardless of how i feel mentally. my therapist called it unconscious anxiety even though i'm not aware of being scaredanxious, the anxiety still manifests itself in my body. exposure therapy is particularly difficult when it comes to my driving anxiety because often times i start to feel so sick from the anticipation that i don't want to drive.. sometimes i decide to stay home and once i decide that, the sick feeling goes away within minutes. i don't know all the details and i don't know how to make it go away for good.. but it's nice to know that i'm not alone and that there are other people that relate to my struggle.</data>

  <data key="d1">my therapists told me that anxiety is specifically a body thing. they said its the fight or flight mechanism kicking off at the wrong time. you feel anxious about something and your inner caveperson assumes a bear is running at you. then you get shallow faster breathing and faster heart rate in order to get oxygen to the muscles for heavy action. the best way out that ive used is slow breathing. anxiety leads to medical fears, leads to more anxiety and more body symptoms etc. i used to get panic attacks that way and slow breathing can get a person out in minutes, even 30 seconds with practice</data>

  <data key="d1">dizziness started in mid november, went to canberra on the 10th of december and i had my first near faint experience followed by high heart beat and palpitation. dizziness and lightheaded was followed till the 28th of december when i nearly fainted again and had really high heart rate went to hospital. they did blood work and ecg couldnt find a probable cause. went to hospital again 3 days later and no findings were evident. upon my 3rd visit to hospital xray was done of my chest and nothing was found. symptoms lightheaded dizziness heart gets tired quickly especially after a episode sometimes my arms and hands become a little numb. my head feels tension. brain fog a episode causes heat in my abdomen, back and my ears get hot. feels like a pulsating feeling through my body during a bad episode sometimes left shoulder feels warm my eyes sometimes drop tears randomly unable to concentrate at times shortness of breath during episode theres always a tense feeling in my chest and around my heart area. sometimes hits my lower abdomen and i feel nausea makes my stomach make noises. i have difficulty sleeping my head spins more when i close my eyes. i wake up between 13am with a weird feeling as if im scared or something. vision sometimes becomes blurry. fatigue and tiredness. little sudden noises scare me. whenever i have a episode that peaks, my hands and feet get sweaty and i feel heat. my hands and feet sometimes get cold. the feeling in my mid left chest area i cant explain but its as if my muscles are vibrating. when i stand up its seems my head and chest symptoms get worse for about a minute and then settle down. same thing happens when i lay down. it gets worse for a minute till it goes back to how it was. sometimes i can feel it hitting my front part of my head and my sinus feels tense as well. as well as my ears feel the pressure. lying down seems to reduce some tension in my head. i feel bad 80 of the day really bad 15 of the day and alright 5 of the day. 23012022 arms are hot, face is hot, ears are feeling hot, eyes are tearing, tension in head. heat in abdomen and back. hands are cold, feet are cold. 2 hours to stabilise health report for dr i believe my anxiety is chronic, its been with me since a young age i just didnt realise until it became severe. i do worry about everyday situation too much when i think about it now and believe things that arent even real. i got sick around november, one day i just woke up and i was dizzy and brain foggy. it was persistent and didnt go away, over the next month it got worse until i got to a point i couldnt breath and got hospitalised. all tests came back negative and they sent me home. this was a on going cycle 6 times in and out of hospital, nothing was helping. so i went to my gp and she said its most likely anxiety. after this point i think i broke the anxiety inducing cycle. even though my worries and trauma are past the physical symptoms are still here or at least in my subconscious. my trauma last year was my business got burnt down by our competition and my now wife which was a fianc back at the same time the store burnt in which i had trust issues with. my parents had told me shes probably using me to gain citizenship etc, so i was always worried about this and thought she might not love me. so i believe these 2 events were too great for me. lets go back to my childhood, my earliest memory is probably when i was around 10. if i would focus on my breathing it felt like i couldnt breath anymore. i also had these unexplained spinning and dizziness at a young age during sleep time. doctors couldnt find anything. i was always a scared kid thinking about the worse case scenario that might kill me but in reality it was overthinking. in highschool a few times i nearly fainted out of the blue. sometimes during sports ill hit a point where out of no where my heart would start racing and my breathing would become laboured. sometimes over excitement caused this as well. now medications lexapro 20mg 6 weeks, reduce symptoms by about 40. chronic dizziness subsided by 80 that woozy feeling. we also tried zoloft 50mg for 3 weeks than 100mg for 3 days. i think zoloft worked better but i had a massive attack on it on day 3 of 100mg. while i was driving i started to lose my mind and my whole body went on fire as if someone poured petrol on me and lit me and i was itchy for a week or 2 after. so dr esin tapered me off and put me back on lexapro and also prescribed me pristiq and said book a appointment with your phyc doctor asap. im not taking the pristiq yet. she told me either we can continue trying different medicine or you can prescribe a medicine on top of the ssri, also said continue on lexapro and ask dr raiz if i should try a snri or buspar. i was also prescribed cbd oil. i take that 2 times a day, i also have thc incase i have a attack which would calm me down apparently and she also prescribed me valium incase. so far in the 6 months since my illness began ive had 1 full blown attack. if anxiety had a scale and the attack is 1010, my persistent anxiety is always 247 between 4510, so its pretty much chronic at this point. i took valium for 2 days for the tapering off period but it doesnt seem to do anything? i assuming the affect is felt greater when youre having a attack or high anxiety periods. havent had any psychotic episodes since i had the 2 last time i told you which is good. im 50 back to work. trying to keep my mind clear and i am going to gym 3 times a week with my wife. but i believe i need more support and more reassurances that it is anxiety that is affecting me. symptoms dizziness burning tongue headache nausea metallic taste in mouth hot flushes fatigue numbness in hands pins and needles brain fog startled easily blood pressure problems heart feeling heavy fast heart beat feel like im dying losing my mind losing control very negative thoughts intrusive thoughts hyper reactive blurry vision cold palms and feet sweaty palms and feet hot flushes feeling sick flu like psychotic episode weak limbs digestion problems numbness nightmares and many more its wide spread though now i think i might be getting better or the medicine is helping. i couldnt even go outside when i first came to you, i would feel like fainting all the time. now its a rare occurrence but the other symptoms are persistent and always there. for example if i go to a shopping centre my brain becomes foggy again. i dont have to think or feel anything it just happens in my subconscious. i think i tolerate the medications pretty well and they all have some degree of effect, but its not enough for me. for example my sleep has drastically improved. for the last 2 years i wouldnt be able to sleep more then 4 hours now i have trouble waking up in the morning which is a good thing. i sleep a solid 68 hours which is a good improvement. i also tried the cannabis thc once and it made me feel relieved for the first time in 6 months i felt my muscles all loosen up. i felt the anxiety trying to hit me within though like as if thc put it in a cage and it was trying to get out. so obviously it doesnt fix the problem but masks it. medications ive tried lexapro 40mg seroquel 12.5mg pregablin 25mg</data>

  <data key="d1">not sure if i remember it correctly but this visualization excercise was one of the techniques i did back when i started treatment for my social anxiety. it greatly helped me disrupt the ruminating. start whenever you catch yourself ruminating, imagine your thoughts to be like a carousel, spinning inside your head. take your time envisioning it in detail. what color is it? is it illuminated or not? in which direction does it spin? is it big or small, near or far? is it fast or slow? when you got a clear image of the carousel in your mind, the next thing you envision is a magic remote control in your hand. you can immediately see that it's magical, because there's a huge golden, glittering button in the center of it. of course it's got all the important buttons, like the buttons for tempo and lighting as well and a display where you can choose the music you want to play. the first thing you do is press the minusbutton for tempo, while you watch the carousel getting slower and slower until it finally stops. now you choose a funny tune to play over the speakers, like the benny hill theme or the looney tunes intro or something else that usually lifts your mood and puts a smile on your face. now you get to press that magical golden button, that transforms the carousel into your favorite form and color with an audible pop. now all that's left is to keep pressing that minus button for tempo until the carousel starts to spin the other way around and observe how you feel now compared to before. end if you're doing the excercise for the first time, it might be helpful to actually listen to the piece of music you want to utilize, while going through that part of the visualization. that way you'll find it easier to remember later. please keep in mind though, that this excercise is no more than a quick fix. to tackle the habit of focusing on negativehurtful outcomes of past or future which usually are the source for ruminating and make a sustainable change, you'll need to build new habitual patterns of thinking. a possible way to do that would be to take 15 minutes in the evening every day right before you go to sleep and consciously think of a few enjoyable moments that you experienced that day. remember those moments where you felt really good, like when you felt the warmth of sun on your skin or a gentle breeze caressing your hair while you listen to the leafs rustling in the trees. it could be the smell or taste of a cup of coffee or tea, seeing the smile of a person you deeply care for, the moment when you cuddled with your dog or cat or how you laughed about something hilarious like a fun story or a joke or something as simple as a warm bath after a busy day. there are so many moments where we feel really good. just think about those situations and envision them from a firstperson perspective, just like you'd actually experience the same situation for real again. imagine that moment as vividly as possible by making it colorful, bright and clear. make it larger than life and step right in. take a look around you. take your time to relish in the experience until you are content and do that 3 or more times for each pleasant experience of the day. it might take a few weeks for it to show any effects, so be kind to yourself. building new habits can take quite some time. well, at least it took me quite a while to make progress. here's hoping you get it faster than me. i hope you enjoy these and whish you all the best.</data>

  <data key="d1">one thing i try to do when my anxiety is high particularly after work is to have my drive home in silence and tell myself i am literally not allowed to think about anything, positive or negative, just nothing. i also envision a light switch and flicking it off my thoughts to help me get into that headspace. it doesnt always work but maybe it will help at least a little bit. at night i have a play list of songs with no lyrics only relaxing lyrics highly recommend agnes obel to distract me.</data>

  <data key="d1">based on my experience, everyone has that exact same problem but acts very cool and casual about it. believe it or not, you aren't the only one. everybody else is afraid of being judged so they wear their new clothes and get haircuts and do all of that stuff to show off on the first day. i'm an older person, who also suffers from anxiety. but trust me on this, nobody knows what you're really feeling on the inside, just you. act like you know the place. be confident that nobody has any idea that you're anxious. try to imagine how everybody else feels. project confidence, it attracts people like flies and it gives you a personal boost. at your age, everyone's trying to seem cool and like they don't care what people think. but they do, very much. think about it, when you see someone on the street, does this average someone look anxious? they could be the most anxious person ever, but you can't tell. they won't either. enjoy your first day of school and try to scope out your future friends. it's all in your head, go in there and act like you own the place. you'll do just fine.</data>

  <data key="d1">antidepressants are the only medications that help me. they also require a lot of trial and error and persistence. you will react to different antidepressants in different ways, and you may need to try several before you find the one that treats your symptoms with minimal side effects. generally speaking, at first you will have nothing but side effects and no benefits. over the course of a month or two, the therapeutic effects will slowly kick in and the side effects will fade. with every antidepressant i've tried, i went through periods where i wanted to quit. i advise pushing through unpleasantness. i am on wellbutrin, which has the most modest side effect profile, though it is often not a first choice for anxiety because it can exasperate anxiety, especially in the short termthough some shrinks argue that it is only marginally worse than other antidepressants but with a much more forgiving side effect profile. in my case, i was pretty miserable with anxiety in the short term, but then it evened out and now my anxiety is significantly reduced. i was also on effexor, which is a more typical first line treatment for anxiety. i didn't have a lot of side effects, but moved to wellbutrin because it also helps with adhd.</data>

  <data key="d1">im so glad you found a strategy that can help you feel more confident and reduce your anxiety significantly! in situations where you cant take a cold shower but are anxious, here are two things you can do, both of which involve cold water as well splash the coldest water possible on your face. it really helps to remove those negative thoughts swirling in your mind. run your wrists over cold water the side that has your palms facing upwards. your wrists have major arteries, so cooling them will help cool the rest of you, too. these strategies will help decrease your anxiety symptoms over time!</data>

  <data key="d1">hi! i think daily journaling, especially keeping a dream journal really helps. it helps you remember your dreams better and adds some fun into your life. i find creating routines are really calming for my anxiety. for example, having a morningnight skincare routine. its not only a routine but taking care of yourself helps you for better self worth and lower anxiety. it doesnt have to be extreme, just a simple one like brushing your teeth, washing your face with something gentle and moisturiser. maybe try to find a hobby you would like to learn. i love arts and i find that working on a craft project really improved my anxiety and calmed my overthinking. but if thats not your thing, learning a new language or literally anything that you like is good to add into your routine. keeping your house, or your living space clean and tidy is a good thing you can add to your daily life. take 15 minutes everyday just to tidy up a little. maybe pick a book and read 20 pages everyday before sleep. well, thats all i can think of, hope it was helpful!!</data>

  <data key="d1">doctors will just try to throw some pill at you which might be what you have been experiencing. psychiatrists are more knowledgeable about what they proscribe and what would work best for an individual. while you have your doctors appointment i would get a bloodwork and physical done just for piece of mind. that way when you have panic you won't be wondering if something is wrong with you when it is actually just anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's not your fault. if she just didn't know how to show love, that's not on you. she is the parent, you where the child, it was never your responsibility to make your relationship better. you did nothing wrong by connecting more with the people who actually supported you. she should never have made you feel guilty for loving your dad's side of the family. as an adult, once you learn to set healthy boundaries you can try to reconnect with her and build a better relationship if you want. but it wouldn't be healthy for you to just take on the blame and try to fix everything for her. you can still improve your relationship if you want and she is willing, but it is okay to set firm boundaries, and it is okay to take care of yourself by getting out of unhealthy situations</data>

  <data key="d1">well you could technically call it selfish as you are putting yourself first, but that's not a bad thing. it is important to prioritize your needs, especially when it comes to your health, which includes mental health. we are often taught that if we do things for yourself it is bad or selfish, but that needs to be changed. it isn't bad to put your health first, it's like how you have to put on your oxygen mask before helping others. technically it might be selfish, but it's actually necessary and good</data>

  <data key="d1">she may be hurt by this, but you aren't hurting her. those feelings are just a product of the situation. she is responsible for how she feels. it's not okay to purposely hurt someone, but that's not what you are doing. you aren't trying to hurt her you are trying to take care of yourself and that intention matters. she isn't your responsibility. it is different if say a parent leaves a bad situation and doesn't protect their kids from it, because that parent is responsible for the kids. it's not okay to try to hurt people, but people get hurt through circumstances in life and that is okay, we can heal from that</data>

  <data key="d1">there was indications of depression but i didn't see a psychiatrist for confirmation, though i spoke with a counselor. i took a break from work and now i am recovering... the perceptions and thoughts i have are now clearer. yes, i hurt my tendon easily, sprain easily, have a poor sense of balance etc. i believe that the lack of exercise further contribute to these ailments. so it's a vicious cycle. but apart from occasional yoga. i find it hard to exercise. i look at others who could easily go for a run after months of inactivity e.g. after an intense work project. but my body's the type that needs very consistent workout, which is gradually built, to be able to run. plus my migraine tendencies, it simply sucks to be me. thank you for sharing about the anxiety. i believe my main issue is anxiety. the depressive episode was burnout related, and i could feel more anxiety now that i'm recovering. i know science is rather advanced and we cannot ignore the link between chemical reactions on psychological health in the body, so i wonder if these two main predispositions of mine, anxiety and migraines, do anything to my health. it's hereditary by the way. all the women on my mum's side of the family suffers from migraine until they gave birth and became a mother. then some neurological and psychological issues happened during menopause, one's has neurological issues, one had depression, another a combination of anxiety and depression all diagnosed. even my sister who's escaped the migraine tendencies was diagnosed depression at a young age of 24. i'm not sure if i'm overly anxious about not becoming like them. but i make very intentional efforts to try to not be like them!</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm not really sure about the science behind it but my doctor said that migraines i also get them maybe a few times a month can also be caused by anxiety among other things. also, good question on the effect of anxiety migraines on the body. i don't know but i think it could have a negative effect if the stress was constant and severe enough. as for exercise, definitely don't do anything super stressful on the body if you're not used to it anymore. i personally gained a few stupid injuries because of that 1 included from running after not running for months. i know it sucks, and i hate it too, but starting with low less stress exercises and then slowly moving up is the best way to do it if you want to reduce the chance of injury. don't forget that a tendon that was injured will never be the same as it was before the injury, even if it healed. on the bright side, i believe muscle memory is a real thing, at least i always seem to get pretty close to my prime pretty quickly. it definitely didn't take me as long as the first time. also, those people may or may not be ok, and they may or may not have been doing some other exercises you are not aware of. it's better to try and not focus on them because at the very least it makes you feel bad about yourself.</data>

  <data key="d1">omg yes! i have literally been experiencing this exact thing for the last couple of weeks and it's such a coincidence that you're bringing this up now. it's basically having the physical symptoms of anxiety without your mind actually being anxious at that moment. it's the physical reaction without the mental aspect. i had to explain this to my therapist in my last session. i get butterfliesstomach in knots, shaky feeling, it's as if my body is going into fight or flight mode without any mental trigger. my therapist recommended me to treat the physical symptoms as they happen. so taking peptoantacids for my stomach, a weighted blanket for the shakiness, and maybe try breathing exercises to try to calm my body. but it's not always that easy to make it stop. i honestly don't know why this happens, but i know it's a part of gad. it's very annoying though because my mind is actually calm for once but my body won't cooperate!</data>

  <data key="d1">look up generalized anxiety disorder. it is really tough to rationalize with anxiety not caused by thoughts. i was waking up with my heart impersonating the screaming sun from rick morty, the wedding squanchers. got anxiety meds from my psychiatrist and now i'm back to a point that i can actually use my coping mechanisms because i'm not vibrating with anxiety 247. those are called the physical symptoms of anxiety and can be chronic for different reasons. mine is probably because chronic pain makes my body release adrenalin indiscriminately. so it's just stressed out all the time regardless of my thoughts.</data>

  <data key="d1">im a therapist. er, its kind of friendly to my anxiety, kind of not? i put a lot of pressure on myself with my job as i want to help my clients as best as i can. but i cant control my clients decisions and choices, their improvement is not up to me. theres a lot of uncertainty and ambiguity in this field which is hard for my anxiety. its friendly for my anxiety because i only see one person an hour. i hated retail because i saw multiple people. im shy with my clients when i first meet them even though i have to pretend im not, but after a month or so its a lot easier for my social anxiety. so the fact i get to build relationships is a plus for me. my anxiety did influence my career path. i was interested in the helping profession ever since i was young i originally wanted to be a teacher but i didnt like the student teacher ratio lol, and in high school i really liked psychology. i started seeing a therapist for anxiety so having that experience finally helped me realized i wanted to be a therapist. i think it really depends on the individual. everyones anxiety manifests differently. for me, i didnt want to work with multiple people at once or in a fast paced environment. i wanted to build relationships with the people i provide a service to. i think people with anxiety can do whatever they put their mind to. yes, its a significant hurdle, but it isnt impossible to cross. the key is being able to manage. my anxiety hasnt disappeared by any means. i still struggle. i still go to weekly therapy. but i manage it, and im able to do the work. setting your boundaries is really important too!</data>

  <data key="d1">i work in p which probably sounds stressful and it can be. it's fast paced and you have to be versatile and spend time amongst many different people, many much more powerful than myself. however, when something goes wrong at my work, it's something that's out of my control. if i've been professional and done everything i can, then i can rest a bit easier knowing that. i make it clear what actions are mine and what i've done, i am honest when i don't know something and i always pull my weight. it's when i know i've fucked up that i get stressedanxious. it also helps that i've had supportive and helpful colleagues and managers, which is a huge part of having an anxiety friendly workplace. that part is just luck really. it also helps in general just being confident in your own judgement and skills, which comes over time. if i felt out of my depth at work, it would be a different story. before this i worked in retail which was terrible for my anxiety because i had to deal with horrible people both customers and colleagues. i dreaded going to work because i didn't know what i was going to be dealing with. but it made me not afraid to stand my ground when i know i'm right about something, i guess it made me tougher. every job is a learning curve and no job is perfect either.</data>

  <data key="d1">sounds like you've been through the wars today, well done for getting through it dude. defo echo what the other commenter mentioned, takes strength to push through discomfort. allow yourself to feel how you want to feel, acknowledge the frustration and stress. once it passes reflect on the day for an hour, maybe the next morning over breakfast. ask yourself what can be learnt, if anything. if nothing that's fine too. then by the time you've washed the dishes mentally put a full stop to it and move into a new day with a reset attitude. even if you manage 1 of any advice given or input from yourself that's a win bud. hope tomorrows a better day</data>

  <data key="d1">i do agree with you. i challenged my self and went but i couldnt handle the situation probably because i felt that i was forced to. i saw no reason in what i was doing. my colleagues said that i was being dramatic but it is truly intolerable. i have went out my comfort zone many times before, i struggled but i felt that there was a purpose so it made it easier for me but this time i did it because i wanted to prove others wrong but it was a huge mistake from my end.</data>

  <data key="d1">i am so sorry that she said this was psychosis it is not, that was wrong of her to do. you are totally okay and these feelings will pass. i've heard from several people that zoloft exasperates their feelings of dpdr which is also not rare! i've experienced it myself and it's very scary, but it will pass. some tips try pushing hard on a wall to help ground yourself. you can also cross your arms like a hug and tap on your shoulders. if you have lavender, give it a big sniff. i also recommend an app called dare it's an anxiety app that has a guided meditation specifically for dpdr. you're okay, you're safe, and you're strong. this will pass, please do something nice for yourself!</data>

  <data key="d1">this was me in nursing school. i felt like i was literally dying, suffering through daily panic attacks and a whole host of physical symptoms air hunger, dizzy, vision was weird, floor literally felt like it was moving when i walked etc. because i was too stubborn to go on medication. and obviously i was convinced i had 8 million different diseases from all of it. after 6 months of this, i finally forced my fianc at the time now husband to make me take the medication because i was so scared to that step. within 23 weeks, i could feel my life starting to come back. it was like someone flipped a switch and suddenly all the debilitating anxiety and physical symptoms started to go away. it 100 gave me my life back. i eventually weaned off of meds a few year later and was fine without them for quite some time. give the medication a chance and if it doesnt work, there are so many other ones to try. be patient and be kind to yourself. its going to get better im proud of you for taking this step today because i know how hard it is. hang in there!</data>

  <data key="d1">theyre pretty constant, but float around and change in shape and size. no rhyme or reason that ive been able to determine, yet. i hadnt noticed them until sometime last year, at least more predominately. they are always black but sometimes look like the edges outside are burned almost, like with a lighter charcoal or brownish hue to the edges. sometimes there are multiple stuck together and other times larger ones. i can almost get them to disappear by focusing really hard on something beyond them. ive had severe post concussion symptoms for the last two years, that also may be playing into my vision changes. but, no answers yet. i have extreme anxiety, depression, ptsd, addiction and borderline personality disorders. plus now, traumatic brain injuries. im a mess, i know! i just wanted to let the op know i experience similar and also see what others share on the topic. intrigued. do you know the reason for them for yourself? have you always had them, or when did you first start to notice them?</data>

  <data key="d1">could be. i have an eye doctor appointment in early november during which i hope to see if theyre warming for something serious. because ive had a more active eye health history, just want to be sure something more serious is caught, if possible. if floaters, can be normal but not for my age. theyre always there, just seem to come and go in different places within the eye. the black holes are pretty constant, the colorful trails come and go. i guess ill find out more when i see the eye doctor. if yours arent typical floaters, do you know what they are? i hope nothing serious.</data>

  <data key="d1">i get this a lot. just the other day, i was having a stressful day at work and had chest pains for like 6 hours with feelings of nausea coming and going. came home, it went away and didn't come back. i also have a history of pericarditis swelling of the tissue around the heart so every time i feel a pain in my chest it makes me panic cause the last time i had pericarditis it literally felt like i was having a heart attack for 3 days straight. i literally keep a bottle of naproxen treatment for pericarditis in my purse in case it comes back cause it makes me so anxious lmao. however, if it is a pain that comes quickly and then goes away, it is most likely just a symptom of anxiety as chest pains can be a really common symptom. normally if you are having an issue with your heart for example when i have a bout of pericarditis, the pain will be almost constant and will not just come and go. you will also likely have issues doing day to day tasks because of the pain. the feeling of nausea was likely just a panic response to the pain given that it came and went quickly. i'll also get the sudden feeling of throwing up when i get really anxious about something. i literally almost had to pull over while driving once cause i almost threw up in my car, then it quickly went away and i was fine. our brains can do crazy shit. even just now thinking and talking about having chest pains is giving me chest pains cause it makes me anxious. take this part with a grain of salt cause i could be wrong but from what i know gi gas can also cause chest pains which is common and no cause for concern, think things like swallowing too much air when eating, etc. but if your bp and heart rate is fine, you should also be fine. of course if it's really worrying you, if you can, schedule an appointment with your doctor to go over your concerns and maybe get some simple tests done just to make sure.</data>

  <data key="d1">you're very welcome! paxil could be a reason, although it is a pretty rare side effect for that drug. if it continues to happen, it might be worth bringing it up with your doctor. thank you, i appreciate it 3 and yeah, heart attack symptoms and other heart issues will primarily be on the left side, the right side is possible, but very rare and almost definitely not a symptom of a heart attack. a weird thing is, if you're female and having a heart attack, a lot of women report having no chestleft arm pain, but rather things like upper back pain andor feelings of indigestionheartburn.</data>

  <data key="d1">this has happened to me, i know exactly what you are talking about even though it is difficult to explain. i wasn't on hydroxyzine, it was before i was on any anxiety med. every time i started to fall asleep i would jolt awake in sheer panic, heart racing, thinking something is horribly wrong but didn't know what. i would try to calm down but would have a hard time falling back asleep. my body would get so exhausted that i finally would fall back asleep and it would happen again. i do think it is from anxiety and maybe the meds you are on aren't taking away your anxiety or panic. i learned that this is a fight or flight response. when we have too much adrenaline, our body is in a constant state of fight or flight even when there isn't danger. zoloft helped me tremendously coming from someone who has bad health anxiety to try anything new. however, i had to get off zoloft due to weight gain and its happening again which confirms my thoughts about how it stems from anxiety.</data>

  <data key="d1">for the past 3 days. it's hard to describe so i apologize in advance, but i'll suddenly wake up feeling somewhat fearful. i look around the room nothing to wake me up or make me feel fearful. i'll just suddenly break from my dream and wake up. my chest feels a little tight, almost like there was a muscle spasm and that caused me to jolt up. it's not painful but i do feel very fatigued when it happens.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've only taken hydroxyzine during the day, so i've not experienced this myself, but i did have this with mirtazapine! it was supposed to help my insomnia, but it made my sleep even worse between the vivid nightmares and jolting awake several times a night, sometimes waking up to a fullblown panic attack. the lack of sleep made my daytime anxiety worse, so i quit taking it. my doc switched me to trazodone, which knocked my ass out hard no dreams, no waking up, i felt nothing for 8 hours. it was the best sleep of my life. edit to add hydroxyzine is an antihistamine, and most people build up a tolerance to the drowsiness side effect very quickly. for people who take it during the day, that's a good thing, but for treating insomnianighttime anxiety, it's counterproductive. you might consider trying a different medication like trazodone, which takes much longer years to build up a tolerance to</data>

  <data key="d1">you may need something to help with sleep trauma? i know that sounds weird but i'm on hydroxyzine 50 mgs 3 times but to help me sleep im on prazosin 3mg. they started me at 1 mg and worked me up to 3. it helped me a lot. i also have trazodone for nights nothings working. prazosin is a blood pressure medication that is approved for ptsd treatment. its given to people with nightmares and sleep disturbances from such and i believe anxiety too. i would maybe talk to your dr and see if something like that you could benefit from. i only use the trazodone like every couple months. thankfully bc it puts weight on me lol</data>

  <data key="d1">something similar keeps happening to me. it's been going on for about a year, but would only happen once or twice a month. the last month its happening almost every night. my mom suggested it might be anxiety. maybe i will try the full 25 mg dose of hydroxyzine. for me, i get super paranoid that there's something wrong with me. it feels like dizzy, but not. like my heart rate is funky. like i'm not breathing but i 100 am. i've checked my heart rate, spo2, blood pressure, and even fell asleep listening to my heart i have some medical background, so i have all this in hand. everything checks i out. it's kinda nice knowing that i'm nit the only one.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi! we have the same bad habit. i also google my symptoms on the internet and would get anxious over it. i know how tiring and draining it can be. however, i am here to assure you that everything is fine and will be fine. focus on the things that give you joy, not those which eat up your joy. in my experience, that bad habit only makes my anxiety worse. so, distract yourself when you can. develop new hobbies or do activities that you were once afraid to try. you are still young and you have a life ahead of you. do not let your anxiety win over you. you are so more than that. rooting for you!</data>

  <data key="d1">so i've been wondering about this. like, when i was just out of high school there was a lot of noise about 'prozac' being this new wondertreatment for depression. this was back in the 1980s. my own anxiety problems didn't start until 2002. so my first assumption was that there would be new versions of prozac that were much better. nope. there were lots of different types of ssri, but they all had disadvantages and the success rate wasn't any higher in general than it was when prozac was introduced. well, i thought, at least as i take the drug with the least bad sideeffects zoloft it will only be a matter of time until they come up with new drugs i can try. nope. now it's 20 years later and absolutely nothing has changed. i haven't even heard of any possible new developments. the only 'new' treatments for anxiety that might be coming soon is use of stuff like lsd, ketamine, and magic mushrooms to treat anxiety and similar problems like ptsd. but the research on those was big news 15 years ago and doesn't seem to have gotten anywhere near an actual product. here in nz i can get ketamine if i join a study but it's extremely limited and so far no shrink i've seen has known anything about it. i think the problem is in funding of research. there's a limited amount of money, and the existing anxiety treatments work well enough, and keep people buying meds for decades, so they are extremely profitable. the drug companies would see this and mark anxiety as a low priority for research because the existing products make a lot of money and the research cost was paid off decades ago. so they are concentrating research on other subjects, like alzheimers, where no effective treatment exists and so the potential for profit is much higher. that's what i think it comes down to economics.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think two things 1. a lot of it has to do with hardwiring. its tough to overcome our chemistry and nature. 2. the best treatments take an enormous amount of work and commitment. to me, nothing has worked better than actively trying to shift my cognitive outlook, my framing of information that ive taken in. its probably the number one defense against anxiety how i define things, how i choose to look at them. beyond that, i know a person crippled with anxiety hates hates hates to hear breathing and meditation but when done correctly? theres nothing better.</data>

  <data key="d1">what works for memight not work for you, it depends try brisk walking in nature 30 minutes a day and try to hold on to it for at least a month. i've been crippled by anxiety the 2nd covid year so much i was starting to have troubles leaving home. exercising was bringing full blown panic attacks with heart beating like crazy, cold sweat, feeling like i'm gonna die and absolute deflation afterwards. so i had to reflect on last year and had to start again from 0. early bedtime, early wake up. take time to do things. and mainly exercise, exercise, exercise. i started by walking into office 35 times a week 9km before breakfast. after two months, i started to run some sections of it. now i almost completely jog it. added swimming and occasional bike. and that damned anxiety started to slooooooooowly creep away. point is, i didn't find any solution that will last forever. but i can manage these exercising and they keep me well in check. but it requires lot of effort and routines. x200b edit anxiety runs in my family pretty deep and i know i will never get rid of it. but as long as i can manage to keep it in check, i consider it a win.</data>

  <data key="d1">try to get a hold of the 10 cognitive distortions. this is like the 10 commandments of things you shouldn't do if you're an overthinke. these have helped me. it's a simple, mindful attempt to go from oh my god this is going to be awful to maybe this will be okay, maybe something good can happen? or from black and white thinking to accepting of unsettled, contradictory truths and mixed bags. it's a conscious decision to think in a less bleak manner. then your moods and feelings can flow from that. don't get me wrong it's more complicated than that, but that's a big, big part of it. there are also emotions and thoughts and blocks we have that we need to get to the bottom of through therapy, but i do believe our days begin and end with mindset. as for meditating i wasam a terrible meditator. you can't tell me to do a body scan, breathe in, breathe out. fuck you, my anxiety is no match for that. f you headspace! you mean well, but you are remedial and boring. you need to lure me in, you need to trick me into relaxing. occupy my mind with a concept i can latch onto. that's why the app called waking up my sam harris has been a godsend. true, mindbending concepts and assignments that call for all of my concentration and release from thought. john kabatzinn is good as well. so is eckhart tolle. when i can be reduced to a breathing hunk of meat, with thought activity near zero, because i've been lured into believing that thoughts are meaningless, passing images if i don't assign meaning to them, my anxiety is at zero. it's true. all there is is this present moment, like tolle says. sure, it only lasts 10 minutes, but it can change an entire day. you get to inhabit your body without anxiety, so then, you technically know how to not have anxiety. it's not a switch you can turn on whenever you want, but it's good to know you can get there with commitment. i would buy the illustrated guide to the happiness trap as well. excellent, easy read. ssris were great at times, but i am off of them now. i want to see what my baseline is, and i want to take on more of the responsibility of feeling better. i highly recommend at least trying an ssri if you can, to see what it does. but give it at least 36 months. but before that, follow my advice here. anxiety is based on our wiring, but it's also based on our thoughts and feelings. are your thoughts accurate, or are they distorted? look into it all. you have amazing tools at your disposal to get better, and you can do it.</data>

  <data key="d1">everyone's brain chemistry is so different and nuanced that it can make it hard to treat the root cause of it. when it comes to anxiety, and neuropsychiatric disorders in general, there's so much we know yet even more we don't despite the amount of research that's gone into it over the decades. like someone else said, funding is a major issue. i want my phd research to focus on anxiety and depression but a lot of my research right now is in alzheimer's, and the grant i'll submit will be about alzheimer's which is where the money is. the animal behavior models available to study anxiety and depression are extremely flawed, versus ad or other neurological disorders where a gene can be manipulated to get the animal model. my lab wants to work on psilocybin but the legal and financial hoops we have to jump through in order to do so are extraordinary. i'm hoping the generation of scientists i'm in can help shift the paradigm and really push for better pharmacological treatments.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's actually an interesting history. but it mostly boils down to sexism, discrimination, snake oil doctors, and general stigma of mental illness. also throw in a bit of difficulty, the brain is hard to study and understand. we still don't. historically erratic women, the homeless, soldiers suffering from ptsd, and people suffering from any mental illness were just haphazardly thrown into asylums. these asylums were grossly underfunded. and because of politics would jump between state, federal, and private funding. patients weren't treated, but were more placed in these dumps to removed them from general society. men would throw their wives in these, so they could have affairs or just get away from their wives. sexual abuse was rampit in asylums. and people of color were thrown in at disproportionate rates. with halloween coming up, see how often asylums come up. i know most of the west has moved away from asylums and turned to inpatient care. but the stigma these horrid places left on those who suffer from mental illness remains. enter in quack doctors. treating mental illness with everything under the sun, from weird poop therapies to full on lobotomies. mental health, in a similar fashion to dentistry and optometry, were considered separate from health. of the three, it was also viewed the lowest for a long while in the terms of studying. so funding went to traditional doctors. it's a huge topic, but thankfully, mental health is now like dentistry and optometry a serious field of study. lastly, the brain is hard to study. historically, all mental health was mostly just bias observations. but thanks to advancements in science, we were able to birth the field of neuropsychology.</data>

  <data key="d1">maybe there can be room to think of anxiety as a bit of both, or depending on each particular situation? sure, worrying about not paying bills or living in an unsafe place are real concerns that oftentimes merit worry, but worrying about your plane crashing or other catastrophic outcomes that are near impossible are not warranted and are irrational. we'll never live in a perfect world. there's always gonna be a small chance that you will suddenly get a serious disease or get, i don't know, hit by a lightning strike or whatever. but worrying for days on end about something that has a 1 in a million chance of happening is a disorder, not a rational way of thinking. this is not to judge anyone here. i have experienced my fair share of worrying about stuff i shouldn't worry about. i can see by following this subreddit that people share their worries and they are sometimes ridiculous, because that's the nature of the beast when it comes to anxiety disorders.</data>

  <data key="d1">i basically agree but there's a huge issue with blaming the environment a huge fraction of people, maybe more than 50, don't react to this environment by developing a mental health disorder. most of them are just fine, a small number absolutely thrive on it. so, obviously people's brains are all different, they develop differently, and most of that difference comes from dna, although environment plays a big part due to epigenetic effects as the brain is growing. i had no concept of being anxious or having an anxiety disorder until i had my first panic attack out of nowhere when i was in my 30s. my father has bipolar and i found out in his case it appeared in his 30s as well. there's just an infinite web of interconnected factors and there's no way to summarise the cause as 'the modern world' and expect that to help. in reality, it's people with certain brain types, growing up in certain types of environments, doing certain types of jobs and having certain types of relationships with certain types of people, that end up having serious anxiety disorders. it's your dna, combined with your particular life experience, combined with the modern lifestyle. it's incredibly complicated. we don't have a way of analysing all of those factors for each person and figuring out the precise solution. what we do have is a bunch of bandaids that work surprisingly well the drugs. i guess people latched onto the 'chemical imbalance' thing because doctors, scientists, and researchers hate having to say 'we don't know what's actually wrong with you, we don't know how to fix it, but we do know that these drugs mostly fix things for a lot of people'. and they also don't really know why these drugs work.</data>

  <data key="d1">effective mental health treatment is expensivein us and difficult to find for illnesses that arent gad, add, or depression. also many people view mental health treatment as a sign of weakness, or even part of a satanic plan by their chosen boogieman. the fact that profit motives push for more pills and less prevention doesnt help either. also, education about mental illness in k12 is poor when present at all, so people arent good at iding symptoms in themselves or others.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've gone the same path. i was on pills stacked on pills. chasing side affects from the other meds and you end up almost rattling from all the drugs you take. with all those pills my bp shot up here take these bp meds also, my anxiety was worse here have more pills and i wasn't myself at all, i could either be a total zombie or a side affect riddled mess. doesn't even need to be something 'dangerous' like a benzo, ssri's and snri's despite being 'non addictive' will absolutely fuck you up if you try to get off them anything other than very slowly something pretty much zero doctors will warn you of. so you're still an 'addictdependent', because you cant cope without the 'safe' drugs and the withdrawal can be life threatening in how it makes your mind and body react. breathing exercises and exercise absolutely help, but that's also preventative and very hard when you are in an actual crisis. not impossible, but trying to calm yourself down from a full blow attack and avoiding the quick fix of a pill is a tough transition. i think society as a whole got use to the quick fix of a pill and that's why so many people are on a laundry list of meds. throw in how hard or dangerous it is to ever come off them and you have a society of drug dependents. life without meds is hard, and takes a lot of work over a long period of time. but i'd rather be me than suppressed to oblivion on pills and glad to not have the mountain of side affects from all those drugs.</data>

  <data key="d1">youre missing the point. yes, anxiety is present in everyones life, theres no debating that. its normal for someone to have anxiety about covid or getting a mortgage. what this forum is for, imo, is for people with anxiety disorders, such as myself. anxiety causes me to make up problems that dont exist, to think of everything that could possibly go wrong, to think of the worst case scenario in every thing i have to do. my brain is trying to protect me by sending me adrenaline which sparks my fight,flight or freeze reaction. and like 90 something percentage of the time things play out different than i worried about. so yes, most people anxiety does stem from different things. some its normal things, but for others its literally everything in front of them for the day, and the next day and the next day. its when stress becomes distress.</data>

  <data key="d1">xanax never works for anyone, its great at doing one thing and one thing only teach people how not to handle their anxiety. xanax and other benzodiazepines very temporarily silences the symptoms of anxiety but what do you think happens to that anxiety? does it just vanish into the void? out into nothingness? oh hell no, its being saved up for later. you take a benzo and feel good in the moment, great, now try and take a benzo every day for a week or so and see what happens to your anxiety levels once you stop, and we are not even talking withdrawals here, one week on 0.5mg isnt enough to create physical dependance , its just that whatever anxiety its been suppressing has been tucked away somewhere else, and is more than happy to resurface as soon as the xanax leaves your system. the only thing benzodiazepines teach people is how to easily escape your problems, you dont face your anxiety head on, you dont learn that anxiety isnt dangerous, you just confirm to your brain that anxiety is a danger and benzos are the cure, then before you know it youve been taking 10mg of xanax daily for a few months, and if you stop you are very much at risk of dying from the withdrawals.. my advice for anyone with anxietypanic attacks is this however bad it feels, benzos can and will make it a whole lot worse, stay away. lol people who downvoted me have obviously never seen what benzos can do to someone trying to medicate their anxiety with it.. they are horrible drugs to get addicted to.</data>

  <data key="d1">i snapped out of my anxiety and people call me crazy as a result. because i've completely separated myself from the reasons why i was anxious. like caring what lost souls think of me. i only cured this once i saw the power my pain gave to others. of course when i was anxious i was grasped by the illusions that people were happy, figured out, well grounded and moral. once i lost all care life quickly got personal and i understood my anxieties. i really had to accept to harsh truths. we live in hell and people are demonic. the most comforting thought is the fact that i'm already dead. that's not a conclusion i reached alone more just a simplification of what i experienced after a motorcycle wreak. the nature of most mental health issues is so deep most assumed authorities would cave under the weight of the knowledge. cure of it is, they never had to live in that dark state themselves thus, going to them for help is fruitless as a result. i started reading psychology and it pisses me off how little is known about it especially by institutions that preach helping it. when in fact they only make it worse. a lot of these mental clouds are collectively agreed upon to be personal problems, not a problem of the society in which we live in. this causes the most genuine people to cultivate a fake demon hating themselves for very flawed reasons which drags them deeper to hell. then the only comfort that can be found is usually escapist behaviors like socializing, hedonism, drug addiction. just to silence the demon that's arisen as a result. the most demonic of people are the ones that never criticize their motives ever. those that do criticize their every move are like angels with a dark cloud hanging on them.</data>

  <data key="d1">the reason is if youre not going on medication, anxiety becomes something personal to you and you have to learn to pull yourself out of it. there is great awareness about mental health issues nowadays and a lot of people are learning how to comfort people and help them through talking about their emotions etc, but anxiety is a journey for yourself to work through as well as with help from people around you. i suffered heavily from panic disorder and severe anxiety from september last year to august this year and my life was great before but when it happened my life shot straight down to rock bottom when the anxiety got unbearable. i had to learn how i was going to pull myself out of this absolute hell. i started watching youtube videos about it, started listening to podcasts, started getting outside more, started exposing myself to my fears and repeating it daily, journaled every single day and my mind became more grateful and clear, meditated, exercised, bought a course which is a step by step guide to recovery. theres so much out there for you to get better only if youre willing to research enough and take action enough if you want to truly push through it and recover. anxiety is a journey for you to get through, nobody else is coming to save you and pull you out of it and tell you everything will magically be okay. it requires a lot of work to get to the point where youre starting to be at peace but i believe you can do it and so do all of us in this sub. good luck!!</data>

  <data key="d1">nope, no anti depressants either, havent touched them and never will. my advice is to give yourself a healthy amount of exposure to discomfort, in order to rewire your brain into understanding that discomfort dangerous. the best and most effective way of doing this has to be exercising. i know, its not what people want to hear, but honestly, if you exercise regularly and push yourself, youll teach your body and mind to be okay with feeling bad in a controlled environment, which in return teaches your brain and body to handle this same feeling even when its out of your control. you build resistance to dynorphins, the chemicals responsible for stress, and make yourself more susceptible to the pleasurable feelings of endorphins instead. saunas do a very similar thing too, major discomfort in a controlled environment, which in turn teaches you to handle it in any situation. so rough exercice, saunas, eat healthy too! keep your cardio up a lot of peoples anxiety seems to be related to their heart health from what ive seen and also find a purpose, a reason to live, dont just wander around waiting for purpose to land you on the head, seek what you desire and work towards it. with all these things in hand you will not have time to even pay attention to your anxiety, and before you know it youll wake up and realize you havent felt that panic feeling in months. i speak from experience and anecdotally from the experiences of many others around me.</data>

  <data key="d1">most medication only push it aside, if you stop taking them, you go straight back to where you were. things like bezosxanax are effective at stopping the symptoms temporarily, but they are addictive and has a whole host of symptoms if you stop taking them. the only way is to fix the root cause of the anxietywhether it be chemical or environmental or fix what causes the symptom of anxiety flightfightfreeze response if the root cause cannot be fixed any time soon. maybe you work with people that cause you undue anxiety. your options to fix your anxiety is 1 get rid of the people you work with highly unlikely see if you can go to another department to work atdoesn't fix the issue, but might have better people, or learn to work with your anxiety symptoms which is very hard alone and requires a combination of things like cbt or dbt or another type of mindfulness techniques.</data>

  <data key="d1">there is a simple answer to this, but not so simple to respond to it is all subjective. treating mental health issues is not , nor will it ever be, like treating a woundsickness that can be treated with fixing a broken bone or stopping physical pain. really, it is that obvious. what you experience is going to effect you in different ways. even if we go through the same exact trauma, there are way too many variables, thousands, which are never the same. human beings are extremely complex, for many different reasons. people can blame the system all they want, but the fact is, the morons running the system are also human, which means they are subject to failure on massive levels. blaming the system is also a copout, because people expect those incharge to somehow find a magical way to just fix people, when it is us who do not do enough to change things.</data>

  <data key="d1">all of those factors are significant but imo the biggest problem for those of us who experience actual panic attacks and gadmd is our dna. its a bigger factor than all of the external stuff for most of us. but yes, we should have better options in terms of access of all in need to mental health practitioners and better medications or other treatments, let alone a better and more compassionate society. especially when there are literally millions of people in the us alone that have these conditions. alas i think the compassionate society is not going to happen for a good while, its more realistic to hope that newer treatments and medications and perhaps personal genetic modification i dont know if this is feasible with an internal structure like the brain, but there is a form of this used to treat cystic fibrosis by swapping out the bad allele for the good allele in the lung surfaces at least will make pathological anxiety diminish or perhaps even give us a cure of a sort. so there is hope and even now current treatments do make a difference for many of us. however i do understand the frustration of those who are treatment resistant or have major external factors that they cannot change that are the cause of their condition as in ptsd or other trauma caused anxiety. no one should have to feel anxiety at a such a level that it becomes the major problem adversely affecting one's life.</data>

  <data key="d1">hard disagree on this. i had my first panic attack in my early 30s and i know people who had their first attack as late as in their 40s. it runs in my family on both sides and is clearly genetic. i know what normal life was like before that first attack and the gadmd that came with it and it was like day and night to compare it to what followed. it took time but medication and therapy made it go away like a bad dream, but it recurred twice afterwards but a change in medication yes they often dont work forever fixed it again. in two of the three times there were no significant stress factors that i can identify that brought it on, only the last time was their something and even then the real stressors death of parents came later in the year that i got sick, so it took a bit longer to get it under control. make no mistake, i have no shame nor feel inferior in any way to neurotypical folks, i was born with these genes so its not my fault in any way any more than any other genetic condition is. i do accept that there are people who might not have developed a serious anxiety condition which i would define as actual panic attacks or gad to the point where one loses weight for lack of appetite and sleep and the anxiety is the central problem in their lives but have gone through a traumatic event that allows the anxiety disorder to develop. but i know far more people in my life that had it run in their families and really had no special trauma but developed it anyway, mostly in their 20s to early 30s.</data>

  <data key="d1">anxiety, or what it does in the body, is a natural instinct that weve always needed. we just dont need it all the time. as others have said, our modern world leaves us unable to distinguish when we need it and when we dont. mastery over anxiety takes hard work and there is no cure its like a bodily function that we have to put into balance when its out of whack. of course medicine can help and should be accessible to people who are at great risk from their anxiety but i think ultimately the only effective long term treatment or cure is really in facing and accepting your anxiety, getting to know it and its root causes, and strengthening the resilience of your mind against it through various techniques including mindfulness and meditation. thats not easy to sell and package. it takes education and dedication for the individual.</data>

  <data key="d1">i dont want to be harsh, or undermine what you feel. i feel that anxiety as well. i also suffer from this condition. that being said, the only thing that has helped me improve is to stop blaming the environment or external factors and start focusing on my own feelings towards these externalities. focusing on my feelings and thoughts, and really meditate on them and discover the reason why i feel how i feel. i realized that the best treatment possible at least, for me is to change my perspective on life itself. it is not easy, and i am still learning. the solution, as you said, comes from within. drugs and distractions can help, but, in the end, the only thing that really works is understanding your feelings and ultimately, learning on a very deep level who you really are. the things i said have been extremely broad and of course, not detailed enough. but in the end, it comes down to 4 things comprehension, acceptance, love and living.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think the problem is in funding of research. there's a limited amount of money, and the existing anxiety treatments work well enough, and keep people buying meds for decades, so they are extremely profitable. the drug companies would see this and mark anxiety as a low priority for research because the existing products make a lot of money and the research cost was paid off decades ago. precisely. why should pharmaceutical companies care? everyone is already forking over money for their ssris indefinitely. plus you can't patent things like ketamine or psilocybin mushrooms, so there's no real money to be made. so no progress takes place. this is what happens when we live in a society that prioritizes profit above all else.</data>

  <data key="d1">i am also like this but then i met someone who had the same problem as me and we got along better than any of my other relationships and after awhile i didn't worry about it bc i felt like they were someone i could actually have a future with and i thought they felt the same. but they broke up with me out of the blue bc they hadn't been in a healthy relationship b4 and it made them nervous. they said they still loved me and wanted to be friends but couldn't handle a relationship atm.</data>

  <data key="d1">im sorry. i have health anxiety as well. its really messes with your life huh. you think every ache and pain is an awful underlying disease. ive dealt with this for 5 years now. it got better for me, but for some reason i got a panic attack two weeks ago and my anxiety has been super bad. i feel like im dying of anything and everything possible. do you do anything to distract yourself? talking to people helps me. crying and letting it all out also helps.</data>

  <data key="d1">when i first got super sick because i wasnt eating due to anxiety i didnt know it at the time i was constantly going to the doctors thinking they had missed something. that there is no way i can feel this sick and nothing be wrong with me. eventually somehow it went away little my little. or at least i wasnt worried as much about it but it was still present. i guess i should have managed it better throughout the years because it has come back. im thinking of doing therapy now or even ask for medication. i wish i liked playing video games but i cant get into them. what do you play?</data>

  <data key="d1">i had health anxiety really bad when i was a teenyoung adult. id google everything which made it worse. therapy really helped. so did this one thought think of all the things youve been afraid of over the course of your health anxiety. what are the chances that all of those are true? no chance. knowing i was wrong about some of my fears gave me immense relief. i thought, i cant have stomach cancer, a brain tumor, ovarian cancer, botulism poisoning, and heart failure all at once. when you lay out all of your fears, you almost cant help but chuckling at yourself.</data>

  <data key="d1">you are not crazy. one common characteristic of anxiety is thinking you are crazy or secondguessing yourself. just think of being in a heightened state of sensitivity for the moment. imagine you drank a cup of coffee and are just a little excited. try to find an activity you enjoy like watching netflix or walking outside and shift your focus. what feels like everything going to hell is just your mind overreacting.</data>

  <data key="d1">the fact that youre afraid of going crazy and are aware of this state, is in an of itself is a sign that youre not, dont let this get you worked up, understand that youre in a hypervigilant state, and maybe try something that will help you relax? meditation, a walk, some chamomile works like magic i promise, hope you feel better.</data>

  <data key="d1">i am not a doctor, but if something is actively lowering my quality of life like that i would rethink taking it. maybe try taking a quarter or half of what they recommended until you can contact them. ssris shouldnt be stopped abruptly, that can also cause feelings of sickness. i have tried pretty much every ssri and they all make me sick too and i dont take them. id rather have my anxiety than feel physically sick and still be anxious cause them shits dont work for me. but yea those are pretty common side effects in the beginning and they will prolly tell you to just power through</data>

  <data key="d1">i have gerd lpr for years. even tho i'm on a diet, the shortness of breath still remains. anxiety attacks makes it worst. when it's really bad it will go to full blown panic attack and i will be feeling lethargic for days. i'm sorry you're going through that. try to calm your mind. if you can still take a deep breath there's nothing wrong with your lungs and heart. anxiety gives our body tons of aches. pain here and there.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes. you are not alone. you may feel alone. but there are hundreds of thousands that feel like you. i have many of these symptoms. when i wake up i feel it rush in. stomach in knots, nausia, tight throat, etc. my fingers and toes get light and tingly from shallow breathing...too much co2 in body. it's hard. for someone who is new to this, it can be hard to hear the solution is a lot of hard work and not an overnight thing. you need to make a lifestyle of it. eat right, stay hydrated, exercise, yoga, meditation, therapy, pharmaceuticals if needed, etc. anxiety gets worse the longer it's left. so start working one step at a time and build a lifestyle around healing your mind. each day we have to work at it. it's hard, but what's needed in my humble opinion. you got this!</data>

  <data key="d1">what does that even mean?! to pray because your problems could be a demon?! how is that supposed to help you??! im so angry for you. please find another therapist. instead of praying, maybe lean into whatever you do believe and fact check what that saying means against what you believe. or expand on what that saying means to the whole world to poke holes in it. the average lifespan is around 75? if this were a simulated game in which they are trying to get people to kill themselves they are doing a horrible job lol so that most likely means that isnt the goal of the game if there even is a game. personally i dont believe we are just playing a game, but if we were.. the goal of every game is to always outlast the other players. and in this life, by outlasting other people its by living healthy happy lives.</data>

  <data key="d1">i pretty much had them every time when i felt nauseous. it usually was at night, but lasted into the day as well, and eventually went away when i managed to eat without throwing up. genuinely, i still don't know what exactly it was. i've since gotten a tentative pots diagnosis, which explains the nausea, but not the tremors. the only thing that helped me in the end was bettering my eating habits. like, i started getting breakfast and eating smaller meals, and really got into sports, and now i haven't had these tremors in ages. occasional nausea and heart rate spikes, but i no longer feel like death at night lol i really hope you'll feel better soon! hope you find the answers you need, best of luck</data>

  <data key="d1">i think the key to success is identifying when you're spiraling and taking steps there to prevent that from making your symptoms worse. something like sitting in a quiet space, taking deep breaths, while practicing some positive affirmations could help with this but it's ultimately different for everyone like you, i also struggled with daily anxiety and also heard lots of advice as to how one can deal with it. i tried medication, therapy, etc and nothing seemed to work. the panic attacks i had alongside depression and potential bipolar disorder really made living.. a drag. it was physically taxing to deal with my anxiety on a daily basis. who the hell likes feeling like they have a knife in their chest 247? so i did what you said and took time to sit with my anxiety. that ultimately helped me more than anything else i tried. by confronting my anxiety and understanding it's roots, i learned that in my case my anxiety manifests itself when i'm unhappy about something i'm doing. so in a lot of ways, it's my mind telling me i could be doing better. i get this isn't a universal thing, but it really helped me to embrace this. it was the first step i took toward coexisting with my anxiety shortly after this realization, i began to experiment with psilocybin mushrooms. pairing that with my findings, and constant introspection, allowed me to effectively cure myself of anxiety. i haven't had a panic attack in over two years, and have fully embraced the anxiety that's a part of my core persona. it'll flare up from time to time, but that's okay. it's a part of me that i live with and have learned to live with. if i really need to settle down, i deserve the space and time to sit with those emotions and work through whatever i'm experiencing. we all deserve that. we can all do this. we need to be especially empathetic toward ourselves because it's damn hard to live with anxiety, so it's kind of like a superpower to learn to deal with it effectively.. especially without the use of medication. which by the way? is also awesome. so many people learn to coexist using medication, and that's fine too. so long as you never forget that at the root of it all, you are you and you are capable of some pretty amazing things x200b hope this helped!</data>

  <data key="d1">my therapist told me stuff like this is a sign of stress we don't know what to do with. it's the same why babies cry when they are hungry, because they don't know what to do about it. when we're adult, we do this instead. also skin picking, nail biting, hair pulling etc. so it's important to find and eliminate whatever is causing the stress.</data>

  <data key="d1">i had a very similar, but not quite as extreme, experience last night. didnt go to the er. but i am slightly traumatized and still feeling off this morning. after doing some research, i think it may have been a thcinduced panic attack where i experienced depersonalization and derealization. i think your experience sounds similar and wanted to share my experience as well. wondering how youre feeling a few weeks later, and if youve consumed thc in any form since then? full disclosure of my drug use since im guessing it played a part in what happened. i am a neardaily weed smoker and have been for close to 5 years now. two nights ago, i was at a holiday party where i drank quite a bit and ended up doing some mdma as well. next day, i was hungover and took my usual daily medications buproprion for depression, strattera for adhd, some other herbal supplements in addition to one 10mg adderall which i got from my bf to help with the hangover. evening rolls around and instead of smoking, i eat two 10mg edibles. i recently recovered from a bad round of flu and another viral illness, so i have a lingering cough and have been avoiding smoking the last week or so. between the illness and partying, you could say my body isnt in tip top shape right now. in case this makes a difference, we usually smoke indicadominant strains of flower and the edibles i took were one 10mg sativa and one 10mg indica. also, this was the 4th time i did mdma over a threemonth span. not sure if this is relevant, but it was strange and out of ordinary. maybe an hour later, my dog wont stop staring at me. intently. she is very sensitive to my moods so im wondering if she could tell something was up. but i remember thinking this is so not normal for her. i took her outside to go potty, offered food, affection, etc but she continued staring. i start googling and only come across articles that shes getting aggressive lol because she is a real life teddy bear doesnt have a mean bone in her body. she had also been to the groomer earlier in the day so theres a possibility it had something to do with that? maybe 10 mins later, my heart starts racing and i feel really weird. i jumped up off the couch and projectile vomited the chipotle i had just eaten. theres vomit on the kitchen floor and all in the sink and im just standing there confused because my brain was literally not working. i felt detached and like i couldnt figure out how to clean up a mess. my hands were shaking really bad and heart was still racing. soon, my vision started to get weird and all i could think was maybe im having an anxiety attack. i made my way to the shower because i had made a mess on myself. throughout the shower, im shaky and heart still racing but able to function physically. my vision was still a little weird but im also half blind to begin with and didnt have my glasses on. my dog followed me and laid outside the bathroom door and whined a few times making me think shes got a sixth sense. while my physical symptoms were more mild during the shower, i was on this weird trip mentally and had lots of anxious thoughts and theories about my life. depressing, sad, and worstcase scenario type thinking. if youve done lsd and heard ofexperienced an ego death, it was like that. after the shower, my vision got weird again and i couldnt see very well. i felt like i was hallucinating a little bit because my vision was like looking through a really warped lens and at one point i just saw my water bottle spinning on a black background. all i can compare it to is weird visuals from an acid trip but i havent done lsd in 6 months. basically, it came to an end when i went to get my boyfriend and told him something wasnt right, i felt like i was having a panic attack. he gave me some melatonin and cuddles and i eventually fell asleep. i think the doomsdayesque thinking may have been a result of having a mdma hangover this depressed selfawareness mixed with a panic attack? im also wondering if my medications, which both increase my risk of seizure, along with the hangover and edibles, all interacted and caused this weird psychotic episode? low key, it felt like i had a mini seizure or something inside my brain. although ive never had a seizure so i cant confirm its similar lol. bottom line, im terrified and going a little crazy trying to figure out what caused this so that i make sure it never happens again. i did have a revelation that i need to care for my body and mind better, so ill be doing self care sunday for the rest of today.</data>

  <data key="d1">i used to be a boxer, and i wanted to become a world champion. i've given it all i've got in my training, and the people there were 5 times stronger than me in the group of guys i'd train with. i'd so many times, almost every time i'd workout with them get fatigued after a couple of minutes as a teen, which they were also older than me. i'd let my hands down and my manager would shout at me hands up. hands. up. you don't put them down, that's your defence. you wanna be a champion? you wanna do this? win? then fight them back and once i remember i cried but they're so strong and i cannot do this anymore and he said in competitions your rivals will probably be bigger than you and stronger. you keep fighting because your goal is where your eyes are focused at, not at how big your enemy is. i've seen the biggest of guys, strongest of them fall by a knockout in front of my eyes itay i don't care about your boxing stories listen to me, no matter how big your fear is. how big your pains are. how terrbiel you've had life. how sad your current mental state is. how tired you are physically. you want a change don't you? then put your hands up and fight. i don't care if you have to start all over again, because now you've more experience, and you'll walk better, stronger, you'll know where to ask for support, where to continue the walk. i've a lot of motivation to give you, but i doubt you'll read all of this mega long comment if i continue. if you do want some more lemme know. bottom line i believe in you, no giving up the fight for how you feel, life, happiness.</data>

  <data key="d1">talk to your doctor andor try to see a therapist and get a diagnosis. it sounds like textbook general anxiety disorder to me. there are several ways to deal with it to some extent. immediate things you can try is breathing calming exercises . you can look these up on youtube. meditation can also help. exercise, especially cardio, is a big one that personally helps me a lot but getting the motivation to regularly exercise is the challenge, at least for me. you could even just try doing 20 jumping jacks right now and see how you feel after that. but really you should contact your doctor if you can. they should be able to provide the best info and resources for you</data>

  <data key="d1">thanks! i recently decided to better myself and my situation mentally so i think i might finally reach out to a doctor, even though i had convinced myself for so many years i would never be able to since its just uncomfortable for me to ask someone for help irl for my mental issues. i take singing lessons, and i therefore am good at breathing properly and deeply, but it just doesn't help me with the anxiety for whatever reason. when i have to worry about breathing properly when im anxious, it just feels like its another thing adding to it.im losing weight right now primarily by diet, but im thinking of starting to exercise, so if that can help then i have even more reason to do so. im just extremely lazy and lack motivation for anything, however i have noticed my anxiety isn't as bad when i walk my dog and listen to music. i really hope i can get myself to contact a doctor</data>

  <data key="d1">no problem. i know all to well how difficult it is to call the doctor lol. all i can say is it's not worth letting it fester into a breaking point before you call. sometimes you just have to force yourself to do uncomfortable things knowing in the long term it will be worth it. it's uncomfortable yes but the doctors and nurses really are used to it. this is what they do and hopefully they'll show compassion like mine luckily do</data>

  <data key="d1">hey check out my post history. i ended up in the er over an edible a month ago and shared my experience on this sub. my heart rate went up to 179 and i had to stay in the cardiology ward over night. it was one of the worst experiences of my life and im still not fully over it. you might experience depersonalizationderealization as a form of shock after this. you might also have nightmares and panic attacks about the incident. i have had both. if you have any questions about the experience or how to navigate it let me know its quite traumatic. one thing i would say is. never take a thc edible of that potency again. you will most likely have a similar experience if you do. i had all this happen on just 10mg of thc so i am unfortunately off cannabis for the rest of my life.</data>

  <data key="d1">at one point in my life, i could out smoke anyone would always be relaxed. then one day anxiety presented itself and nothing was the same. idk why i decided to do an edible, probably because i wanted to do the shit that i used to enjoy. i realize i can't enjoy it like i used to and that's okay. it doesn't really need to make sense to you.</data>

  <data key="d1">while at worst, i've had the nerves on edibles, i've had the scariest panic attack of my life on 5 bong hits. i remember not just thinking and feeling like i was going to die, but that i knew i was going to die. and it was happening any second or any minute from then at that moment. all i could do is brace myself. the fact that my cognitive functions and speaking patterns were broken made me more convinced of my immediate and inevitable death. the only statement i was able to fully say was, i'm so scared! i'm just lucky i had some support to comfort me throughout this horrific moment.</data>

  <data key="d1">smoke vs edibles are very different. smoke is more controllable and doesnt last as long. edibles are digested and last longer with a bigger high. min doses is 5mg with 50mg being a lot. once someone tolerance is higher then yea, you can bump it up. but still even if you are used to it you can still take too much and end up on a bad trip.</data>

  <data key="d1">so basically, thc causes tachycardia elevated heart rate if you take edibles i think its more likely. if you have an anxiety disorder, your heart beating in your chest while youre experiencing the sensory perception changes of being high can cause you to panic, thus elevating your heart rate even more. so my heart rate got up to 180ish while i was lying down, and i was experiencing a ton of chest pain with breathing difficulty. went to the er and had to spend the night in the cardiology ward because my heart rate wasnt going down enough. once it was fully out of my system my heart rate got back to normal but it was really scary, and i unfortunately cant touch thc again.</data>

  <data key="d1">dosage for thc is largely individual to every person. for example, i'm high between 5mg and 10mg. start with 2mg and increase by 12mg each time you partake to find that sweet spot, and once you find your dose you know what you'll need next time. i think you handled being way too high pretty good though! i'm glad you're okay!</data>

  <data key="d1">cannabis industry professional here. weed can and does exacerbate my anxiety, not all the time, but after a too strong edible or too big of a dab i freak out and have to tell myself that it isnt going to kill me. im sorry that happened man, maybe this is your sign to avoid edibles especially homemade or medical grade in the future.</data>

  <data key="d1">i hope it helps you out. i also used to smoke weed and eat edibles, to help with my ptsd. i quit altogether for about two years, and now when i even take or smoke the smallest amount it gives me massive anxiety and panic attacks. i have a major anxiety disorder and after researching myself, i discovered that weed, in any form, can cause panic attacks or even psychosis in people with anxiety disorders. cbd however, can help you with the anxiety. it's not a xanax or anything, but it will calm you down a bit. works best if you take it everyday. hardest part is finding the dose that's right for you. i wish you the best. anxiety is a beast.</data>

  <data key="d1">ive been there. i took a 100mg edible. it got so bad i called an ambulance bc there was no way i could take public transportation to the hospital. a very embarrassing moment, but i was truly in a state of psychosis. i thought i had died and was reliving my death, and the guy i was with at the time was going to murder me. when i was in the ambulance i was convinced they were fake and were kidnapping me.</data>

  <data key="d1">my suggestion is just to stay with joints or bongs. edibles are just way too strong, sometimes it just gives you the same kind of physical and mental feeling of anxiety. in addition to that edibles goes way much longer so it literally feels like it will never end which triggers anxiety to a lot of people. x200b i would suggest edibles to people who are suffering 247 with anxiety. i would have taken them if i knew much sooner.</data>

  <data key="d1">this, 100 i smoked daily during my teens early 20s, and weed always calmed me down i was 39 when i tried weed again mainly for ptsd and insomnia. i started with a roach my husband had left. even that tiny bit had me paranoid, to the point that i couldn't even sit on the bed next to his sleeping body! i tried again, assuming my tolerance was just low. same shit, just hated every second of it. maybe i'm too old? next i tried my best friend's vape she has anxiety and swears by it. i enjoyed maybe the first 5 10 minutes. then i got into my own head my kids were at school, i kept thinking how i'd maintain if there was an emergency. i curled up in my bed, praying for sleep so the intrusive thoughts would go away, until i finally came down. i'm 40 and haven't tried again. so yeah, i miss the old stuff too</data>

  <data key="d1">i tried my first edible a few years ago...i have smoked weed in the past. mostly in my teenage years...anywho, i have chronic painheadaches and thought id give edibles a try... i ate 1 gummy which is what my bf at the time suggested...the first few hours omg...we had so much fucking fun!!!!!!! then i was laying down and couldnt sit up lol it's a weird feeling. it's like ur muscles just stop working...as i said, first few hours we had so much fun then all of a sudden out of nowhere my heart starts pounding and i have an extreme panic attack... i have a bicuspid aortic valve which causes me to have palpitations... he put his hand on my back and said omg babe... i can feel ur heart pounding through ur back after 20 mins of me trying to mentally calm myself down and tell myself it's all in my head i finally said i wanted him to take me to the hospital... he stood up off the bed...started pacing and grabbing his hair and said babe i don't want to be those parents that take their child at 3 in the morning to a hospital cuz one of them took too much....at the time i was like ur a jerk...when i sobered up i laughed. to this day i laugh about that. lol. having my back scratched always calms me down...so he legit laid there with me scratching my back for hours until i was finally able to calm down and fall asleep. lesson here. if ur already predisposed to panic attacks, just stay away from it. also....we never found out why my heart was pounding like i'd ran a marathon. bad reaction maybe?</data>

  <data key="d1">i took a 100mg edible with my friend one halloween night and wooooo thay was an experience, everything felt alow but fast, my breathing felt so heavy but it was normal i was so self conscious thay i'm like gasping for air, i felt nauseous but i was also giggling for half of it i wasn't just high i was stooopid high. i was anxious that i was sitting there thinking i need to go to the hospital but also thinking, for what? so the nurses can laugh at you so i had to hype myself down. i think the worst part was when i tried to sleep it felt like i was falling or not breathing so i'd wake up with a little gasp, in the end i vowed to never take edibles again. its funny now because we were just watching eclipse and goofing around and all the sudden i'm hugging the toilet whispering yet yelling about my breathing while my friend sits on the floor with me so i think my point is hey you're not alooone</data>

  <data key="d1">so the way ive been navigating it is making sure i dont stay alone too much or make sure i have someone to talk to when i start feeling discomfort, talking through symptoms with my therapist, and also compassionate self talk when i start feeling symptoms coming on. i usually am able to calm myself down by literally saying to myself something along the lines of, hey, youre not going crazy, you just went through a really traumatic experience, its totally normal that youre feeling this way, take some deep breaths, youre going to be ok and then ride it out or do something to distract myself or get myself back into reality. mindfulness is also helpful just sort of accepting the feelings without actually trying to suppress them as fighting it can make it worse. im really sorry you are dealing with this too. you might want to check out if you get any depersonalization derealization they have a lot of good info there too.</data>

  <data key="d1">250 mg? if that was me, id probably be the first person on record to die from marijuanna use. not even joking. id probably go into cardiac arrest from that. ive never taken an actual edible, but ive taken a delta 8 edible and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. i started off taking a 12.5 mg gummy and it did absolutely nothing for me except make me tired over the course of many hours. this happened a few times. well one day, it was a special occasion and so i figured 2 would be okay since only 1 in the past did jack shit. worst mistake of my life. i felt nothing again after a few hours, and started to drift off to sleep again. i figured they were dudsuntil suddenly i got a jolt of extreme panic and fear that i have never felt in my life. it was like my body was warning me that something bad was about to happen. i felt nothing but panic for a few minutes and then boom. all of a sudden reality was distorted and i mentally was.losing myself? it was like, genuinely horrible. bad trip. very traumatic. i felt like i had to focus extremely hard otherwise i was going to lose my mind not crazy wise, but like physically literally lose track of it. if i didnt pay attention hard enough it felt like my brain disappeared from my head. i dont know how to explain it. i started violently shaking i was afraid i was going to have a seizure. i sat down while my boyfriend held my hand and i had to quite literally use all of my strength to remain calm and take control of my body. both physically and mentally. physically it felt like my body wanted to throw itself back into convulsions..i had to focus really hard to fight that feeling off. mentally it felt like i was in another dimension not in a good way and i had to focus really hard to keep myself grounded. it was absolutely horrible. i was completely and utterly traumatized. ended up managing to fall asleep after quite some time, woke up at 7am the next morning still a little high. went back to bed. woke up at 9am, no longer high but had anxiety. i felt like a tweaker. like, something was off in my head. felt crazy, like psychosis was starting to happen. it took a solid week for me to feel normal again. even then anxiety still remained. so yeah really long story but thats my experience with drugs . i just think if you have bad anxiety or mental illness in general its probably best to stay the hell away from that kinda stuff. i was so worried i was going to feel crazy my whole life. some peoples brains just arent meant for things like this. it effects everyone differently.</data>

  <data key="d1">omg!!! this is exactly what i went through the day after thanksgiving!! so scary! i did 100mg which ive done many times before with a nice high but i experienced a very similar experience to you. it was the most frighting feeling ive ever experienced. i called 911 and the paramedics told me its a panic attack when they got here. they were annoyed with me cause they said its not an emergency. i literally felt like i was dying or i wouldnt have wasted their time. ive never called 911 before, but i was sure i was dying of either a stroke, heart attack or pulmonary embolism. i told them how much edibles i did and they said thats why im numb and my heart is beating 148 bpm. they called it a thc od and said its something they see a lot of in la since its been legalized. the next three days were kind of weird too. i had symptoms on and off. not as bad as before, but i was worried. i went to the er. i just wanted to make sure it wasnt a stroke or heart attack and play it safe. they did all the testing and it came back normal. it may just take you a few days to feel normal. if you start to feel like that weird tingling feeling just drink water, lay down put a funny movie on or listen to music.</data>

  <data key="d1">glad.to hear you're feeling better and taking the experience in stride. just goes to show no matter how experienced you are, you can still go insanely overboard with edibles. 250mg is a loooot. there's a reason gummies and whatnot are dosed at 10mg a piece. you're supposed to eat one or two pieces, not packages. sounds like your fianc is the one that needs the tbreak. at least, i don't think it's a competition to try and spend as much money on pot in one evening as possible.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know this is a bit dated, but sorrowingwinds, im with you. delta9 is only legal here if the weight ratio of the edible is only .3mg d9. so, to get around the weight ratio they will make say a 5g gummy and it can contain almost 40mg d9. throw 10 in a bag and slap a huge 400mg on the front of the bag. anywho, i was like, i smoke all the time i can handle at least half this 20mg. i feel really good about an hour and a half into it. then hour three hit and its like i was launched into another dimension. i had an almost two hour panic attack at that point. where my mind wouldnt stop thinking every negative thought and my body was suddenly developing every ailment that could kill me. from a twitch being a seizures to quicker heart beats equaling a heart attack. edibles are not my thing apparently.</data>

  <data key="d1">lots of people try to suppress visual effects of anxiety like fidgeting, and in some places it can be looked down upon to discuss those topics. thankfully these days people are being more open about mental health. lots of time there are anxiety help groups where you can meet similar or places like this subreddit where there are thousands of people in this online community. i promise you youre not alone.</data>

  <data key="d1">it sounds like you are feeling really isolated and alone right now, which is a difficult place to be. please remember that you are not alone in this many people feel similar things as you do. anxiety is part of the human experience and it's important to recognize and accept your feelings without judgment so that they can be managed in healthier ways. you don't need the approval of others or a bubbly personality to have value selfacceptance and learning how to cope with your anxiety can help bring relief for these worries. reach out for support if you need it talking about whats going on with somebody who understands may also provide some relief</data>

  <data key="d1">anxiety and social anxiety are two different things. you also are likely to have something else on top of social anxiety. there's just too many to name you need a doctor to nail down what physical ailments you have then move to psychological. otherwise they'll blame one thing such as generalized anxiety. although most parts of this country will no have resources for some issues as they directly diagnose children and not adults.</data>

  <data key="d1">do you have anyone that can be with you? family member or friend? try to distract yourself with doing stuff you like. and hopefully it'll pass by. the symptoms can be because of sertraline. when i took it, i got many horrendous side effects sudden obsession to die, weird bumps on my legs hurt to walk, panic attacks, sudden loss of speech. not everyone gets them but it's a high possibility. but remember if it's because of the antidepressant, the side effect will immediately go away when you stop taking it. i held out for a month should've just waited a week. also ssri medicine never helped me. medicine like buspirone seem to have a higher success rate.</data>

  <data key="d1">it is up to you if you want to be private. but do not feel that having mental health challenges, especially depression is shameful. if you got shot in the leg, would you feel shame for bleeding on things? so, maybe you should not have told that story to those people. but somewhere some time telling that story won't just make you feel better. it will make someone else recognise their own trouble and they will feel better. so even if you made a mistake you got good practice for later. merry christmas, btw.</data>

  <data key="d1">do those people really think you're unqualified and dramatic, or is that how you assume they see you? it's a very natural reaction to be embarrassed and assume that everyone thinks less of us, or at least it is to me. i think most people will be sympathetic to you, though. we all encounter situations that make us emotional, it's just a natural reaction for things. you clearly care about doing the right thing. don't let mob mentality stop you doing that. in the profession that you're in,it's important to make sure that things are being done to a high standard. p.s. your english is great, just try to break things into paragraphs to make it easier to read</data>

  <data key="d1">the brain is extremely powerful. in 2013 i was convinced i had a brain tumour. so much so that i was saying to my wife that i was sorry that we didn't have more time together. i went to ae 3 times in a week. i felt like i could feel a tumour pushing against my skull. i was very dizzy. i was sent for an mri scan my doctor told me that i didn't have a brain tumour but to shut me up he sent me for a scan anyway and it was completely clear. anxiety is very, very powerful. with anxiety you can get somatic symptoms. physical symptoms. sometimes they can't be explained. what i'd suggest is to go to your doctor and ask to be put on medication for anxiety. if you are already medicated i suggest asking for a different medication. there are so many medications out there. you just need to find the right one for you. xanax isn't a long term solution. you need to find something you can be on long term that will help with your anxiety. have you considered talking therapy? to get to the root cause of why you are so anxious.</data>

especially after a episode sometimes my arms and hands become a little numb. my head feels tension. brain fog a episode causes heat in my abdomen, back and my ears get hot. feels like a pulsating feeling through my body during a bad episode sometimes left shoulder feels warm my eyes sometimes drop tears randomly unable to concentrate at times shortness of breath during episode theres always a tense feeling in my chest and around my heart area. sometimes hits my lower abdomen and i feel nausea makes my stomach make noises. i have difficulty sleeping my head spins more when i close my eyes. i wake up between 13am with a weird feeling as if im scared or something. vision sometimes becomes blurry. fatigue and tiredness. little sudden noises scare me. whenever i have a episode that peaks, my hands and feet get sweaty and i feel heat. my hands and feet sometimes get cold. the feeling in my mid left chest area i cant explain but its as if my muscles are vibrating. when i stand up its seems my head and chest symptoms get worse for about a minute and then settle down. same thing happens when i lay down. it gets worse for a minute till it goes back to how it was. sometimes i can feel it hitting my front part of my head and my sinus feels tense as well. as well as my ears feel the pressure. lying down seems to reduce some tension in my head. i feel bad 80 of the day really bad 15 of the day and alright 5 of the day. 23012022 arms are hot, face is hot, ears are feeling hot, eyes are tearing, tension in head. heat in abdomen and back. hands are cold, feet are cold. 2 hours to stabilise health report for dr i believe my anxiety is chronic, its been with me since a young age i just didnt realise until it became severe. i do worry about everyday situation too much when i think about it now and believe things that arent even real. i got sick around november, one day i just woke up and i was dizzy and brain foggy. it was persistent and didnt go away, over the next month it got worse until i got to a point i couldnt breath and got hospitalised. all tests came back negative and they sent me home. this was a on going cycle 6 times in and out of hospital, nothing was helping. so i went to my gp and she said its most likely anxiety. after this point i think i broke the anxiety inducing cycle. even though my worries and trauma are past the physical symptoms are still here or at least in my subconscious. my trauma last year was my business got burnt down by our competition and my now wife which was a fianc back at the same time the store burnt in which i had trust issues with. my parents had told me shes probably using me to gain citizenship etc, so i was always worried about this and thought she might not love me. so i believe these 2 events were too great for me. lets go back to my childhood, my earliest memory is probably when i was around 10. if i would focus on my breathing it felt like i couldnt breath anymore. i also had these unexplained spinning and dizziness at a young age during sleep time. doctors couldnt find anything. i was always a scared kid thinking about the worse case scenario that might kill me but in reality it was overthinking. in highschool a few times i nearly fainted out of the blue. sometimes during sports ill hit a point where out of no where my heart would start racing and my breathing would become laboured. sometimes over excitement caused this as well. now medications lexapro 20mg 6 weeks, reduce symptoms by about 40. chronic dizziness subsided by 80 that woozy feeling. we also tried zoloft 50mg for 3 weeks than 100mg for 3 days. i think zoloft worked better but i had a massive attack on it on day 3 of 100mg. while i was driving i started to lose my mind and my whole body went on fire as if someone poured petrol on me and lit me and i was itchy for a week or 2 after. so dr esin tapered me off and put me back on lexapro and also prescribed me pristiq and said book a appointment with your phyc doctor asap. im not taking the pristiq yet. she told me either we can continue trying different medicine or you can prescribe a medicine on top of the ssri, also said continue on lexapro and ask dr raiz if i should try a snri or buspar. i was also prescribed cbd oil. i take that 2 times a day, i also have thc incase i have a attack which would calm me down apparently and she also prescribed me valium incase. so far in the 6 months since my illness began ive had 1 full blown attack. if anxiety had a scale and the attack is 1010, my persistent anxiety is always 247 between 4510, so its pretty much chronic at this point. i took valium for 2 days for the tapering off period but it doesnt seem to do anything? i assuming the affect is felt greater when youre having a attack or high anxiety periods. havent had any psychotic episodes since i had the 2 last time i told you which is good. im 50 back to work. trying to keep my mind clear and i am going to gym 3 times a week with my wife. but i believe i need more support and more reassurances that it is anxiety that is affecting me. symptoms dizziness burning tongue headache nausea metallic taste in mouth hot flushes muscle pain and tension fatigue numbness in hands pins and needles brain fog startled easily blood pressure problems heart feeling heavy fast heart beat feel like im dying losing my mind losing control very negative thoughts intrusive thoughts hyper reactive blurry vision cold palms and feet sweaty palms and feet hot flushes feeling sick flu like psychotic episode weak limbs digestion problems numbness nightmares and many more its wide spread though now i think i might be getting better or the medicine is helping. i couldnt even go outside when i first came to you, i would feel like fainting all the time. now its a rare occurrence but the other symptoms are persistent and always there. for example if i go to a shopping centre my brain becomes foggy again. i dont have to think or feel anything it just happens in my subconscious. i think i tolerate the medications pretty well and they all have some degree of effect, but its not enough for me. for example my sleep has drastically improved. for the last 2 years i wouldnt be able to sleep more then 4 hours now i have trouble waking up in the morning which is a good thing. i sleep a solid 68 hours which is a good improvement. i also tried the cannabis thc once and it made me feel relieved for the first time in 6 months i felt my muscles all loosen up. i felt the anxiety trying to hit me within though like as if thc put it in a cage and it was trying to get out. so obviously it doesnt fix the problem but masks it. medications ive triedff lexapro 40mg seroquel 12.5mg pregablin 25mg</data>

  <data key="d1">i agree with the other replies, when things get still, sometimes our minds tend to rev up. have you ever tried guided meditations? they force your mind to listen and follow the guides, preventing it from wandering and overthinking. there are many good ones out there on youtube!</data>

  <data key="d1">second this. it was one of the things that helped my panic attacks, which sounds like you may be experiencing. the other thing that helped was the five senses... think of one thing you can see, one you can smell, one you can touch, etc... helps your mind focus on the present.</data>

  <data key="d1">in a way yes, but also no. recognising your anxiety will make it seem worse, but you cannot simply ignore it any more. therapy will eventually give you the tools to reduce it. capice?</data>

  <data key="d1">we are social animals. without fangs, claws, etc. and being pretty weak, we depended on the social group to survive. and, just like modern anxiety is related to these very basic, instinctual survival responses, we are very sensitive to the approval and inclusion of our immediate social group even when we know it's temporary. you don't care what 1 thousand people on the other side of the planet might think about you, right? 'cause you have to know that there are thousands that will hate you for one thing or another. yet, a handful of recent acquaintances make us fear being abandoned in the forest...</data>

  <data key="d1">i've been there with the fear of judgement from others. one thing i'll say is that doing something scary that you're excited about can be really rewarding and not doing it can mean missing out on some of the best things in life. there will always be someone who thinks the thing you make is cool. also there are people out there who don't spend their time making fun of other people.</data>

  <data key="d1">this hurts to read because there is so much truth to it... people really can be vicious. there is always the 5 of the population who are hateful trolls. however too often we exaggerate it in our minds. when the typical person hears that somebody's weird or creepy, he might laugh along, but he doesn't take it very seriously. it's a passing shallow thought. i've laughed at silly online content, but i don't ruminate about it for weeks at a time, i don't think the creator is a piece of shit, i don't think it defines their character. i know i don't have their perspective. i'm just getting a bit of fun and not taking it seriously. eventually i forget about it. when i was in school a lot of people thought i was weird or fucked up. still, it doesn't really bother me because it didn't mean they wished ill on me. once i heard people criticizing me behind my back, so i gently confronted them that i was listening, and they were ashamed. clearly they didn't mean to make me feel bad. as long as we affirm each other's humanity and show that we still care about each other, we can be okay. our first instinct is to get all defensive, and that can lead us astray. don't be afraid to show vulnerability and ask for sympathy because more often than not you'll discover that the hecklers don't actually want to tear down your personal feelings.</data>

  <data key="d1">i did this as well. i was worried that people weren't interested and liking what i was doing, or what i was posting. i would post more on close friends stories with the friends you tend to interact with more. you could also just stop posting, and don't really stress about validation. it's harsh to say you could just stop posting, but sometimes you just need to take a break for a bit and give yourself the breathing room from worry.</data>
