  <data key="d1">honestly bro, most of the time us as humans just need to explore new horizons, so many things youll get to do over the next 10 years and you dont even know it. everyone has a journey bro, what youre feeling is only going to make you 10x tougher than those who have everything handed to them.</data>

  <data key="d1">as someone who has struggled with these thoughts since your age. and now having a daughter go through the same thoughts at 17.i feel you. more than most. dont live for you parents or friends. and dont tell guilty about not having some crazy trauma and still having these feelings. they are pretty normal. live for yourself. and experiences turning 18 and gambling. getting a tattoo. skydiving. turning 21 and getting drunk in a bar with strangers you will never see again but youll remember forever. you have many days and nights full of things that are so great you wont even think about these things anymore. little moments will outweigh the daily bullshit. go to a concert. do something thats uncomfortable. i had a friend in high school go through with it. and hes missed out on so many amazing memories weve had. permanent solution to a temporary problem. hit up a sensory deprivation tank. do anything different and something youve never done and start now.</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you for taking the time to write a response to this, the fact someone you dont even know cares enough to write something is so kind. its also comforting to know someone felt the same way. what made you change your mind? what kept you going and what stopped you from doing anything? i crave experiences like that. things filled with adrenaline that you do when only half thinking straight, smiling and screaming at the top of your lungs. but it doesnt seem worth it. it doesnt seem worth living like this for even longer for experiences ill forget late anyway. when im dead, i wont know all the things ive missed out on, because, you know, ill be dead. thank you for your message again</data>

  <data key="d1">dogs truly are a god send. but do you think thats what hed want for you? do you think that he wouldnt want the love you have for him to go to another dog who needs it? if he gives you love in life, hold onto it and let it be the reason you live. to love and be loved by the dogs you care for. their lives are no where near as long as ours but in our life time we can give many many dogs the time of their lives, and to me that sounds like something worth living for.</data>

  <data key="d1">you say that, but despite things getting worse day by day since 2018, here you are 5 years later. youre strong my friend, and that youve come this far only shows youre getting stronger. for things to get better you just have to change your perspective because things do get better. it might not be raining tomorrow if it was today. the rain may come down hard but the sun will always come back out. once you find your purpose and devote your life to that purpose you gain insight to the things that matter and thats what you have control of, thats what gets better.</data>

'i gotta do this today, this is coming out in a week, this person's birthday is in a month' etc. just postpone if you have no real reasons.</data>

  <data key="d1">please read to the endi cant tell you what to do you are your own person but im hoping sharing my struggle will maybe help change how youre thinking of things im still fighting through my own considerations of doing this myself but this is my take a lot of my own desire to kms and i feel like others may relate too is because i feel such intense emotional pain that my body literally aches and i feel like my whole body feel like its being sucked into the ground from the inside out. i feel sometimes like kms is my only option to make the pain stop. the thought process goes i just want it to end idgaf if i live or not. if its this painful, is life even worth it. i know its impossible to imagine in the moment, but there are ways to get out. because turning the lights off to make the pain stop doesnt give you the chance to actually feel what its like to have the pain stop. i know the thought is i dont care i want it to stop im tired. im not entirely sure if i can make the pain completely go away any time soon but i feel like if i have ever been happy in the past its possible to get to a better baseline. im not convinced living and struggling will be worth it but at this point, im treating it like a survival game. if i cant force myself to stick around for whatever highlevel moral reasons people tend to try to guilt you with whatll i do without yo about your familywhat about this or that, im sticking around purely for the small stupid things i enjoy and because at this point im in a war mindset. i may lose a battle or many. but i want a shot at winning the war and living with my demons y know? you may have no one good around you. but they exist. and if you reach out and try finding resources for yourself, you will find supports to pull you through. i want the pain to stop. but i also want so badly to know what that feels like. call it pleasure seeking or whatever. i just wanna stick around and meet more cats in stores where the store owner calls them the manager its too fuking cute</data>

  <data key="d1">i asked coworkers i knew were safe and have been through similar family trauma to me for resources on managing finances, i called a bunch of crisis hotlines and asked for recommendations for different resources financial assistance, housing, mental health dbt therapy, everything and im making myself a massive spreadsheet to organize this all. this isnt to completely ignore the things i have as an advantage or the fact that sometimes the pain is so big i feel like its swallowing me whole. but, im telling you as someone whos been different levels of suicidal since childhood, doing something about it your problems or whatever can really make you feel better. again, emphasis on the war not the battles. one failure doesnt prevent any future successes from ever happening ever. it took me several years of struggling through shit retail jobs and before that just chronic unemployment to save enough to start planning an escape from my abusive household. right now im just trying to see myself as a survivor cunning, smart, strategic. im really fucking tired. so tired i just want to end it all sometimes. but i want a shot at enjoying what it feels like to not be suicidal all the time</data>

  <data key="d1">let the universe work your way brotha. focus on work and be the best at it. i know for a fact isolating aint it chief. when i was doing that you just sit alone and get suicidal and depressed. force yourself to go out. if your friends dont have time to go out, make plans ahead of time. certain things will work themselves out with effort. then like me, youll look back and be dumbfounded how everything was for a reason and im going through certain things that others dont because god has a different plan for me. hang tough. therapy aint gonna cut it. maybe the meds will. i guarantee you either friends, work, or finding your wife will solve a lot of your issues. you have to go out and take risks. no matter if you get rejected.</data>

  <data key="d1">i had a similar situation. my mum just got mad when i told her about my thoughts, though. she said it was selfish to think of it, and proceeded to say i didn't love her. i assume your father is different, so it should be better. a lot of parents appear to think that calling their child selfish will make them refrain from suicide, but it isn't like that, obviously.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey toby. high school sucks. its hard. people suck. i know this, you know this, its the same during high school and even after. the sooner you can accept this however, the easier it gets. well not so much easier, but definitely not as hard. the thing about bullies is, if they cant bully you, they wont. they prey on your insecurities, and the more you care about them the easier it is to do so. take what youre insecure about the most and turn it into confidence. the more you can accept yourself, the more other will as well.</data>

  <data key="d1">no, it wouldn't have been your fault. i might be wrong, but i think the only two ways you would truly be blamed for someone's death is if you actively told them to kill themselves or if you straight up murdered them. otherwise, their choice was their own. i'm sorry that you've been manipulated this way, but i hope that this could ease your guilt a bit.</data>

  <data key="d1">heyo, i went through some similar feelings in hs, not quite to the same extent but i felt like i had this void in my heart where no matter how much was going right i always felt something was missing. it took me a while and a lot of pain but i eventually found inner peace and self contentment around when i turned 18. im sorry that your friends are treating you so poorly. i know you said you cant avoid them but are there any opportunities to make new friends? you could try joining a club for the things you used to enjoy, that way you could meet people with similar interests and maybe find joy in those activities again. those would be good for you in the short to long term. my other recommendation since you asked would be trying to have your general feelings about yourself come from within. i think a lot of people struggle with their level of happiness being tied to those around them. i know its hard to shift to stop caring about how the people thst dont like you feel about ya. as far as the religious stuff, faith is hard and i understand not being committed. i am 24 and my faith still bounces back and forth every year about if i believe this stuff. but no one is expecting you to know or to never waiver, even the apostles not sure if you are christian but they are gods closest followers doubted god. i think you still have a lot of life ahead of you, you are only 14.</data>

  <data key="d1">yea,that sounds fucked up for sure. i guess i'd say that your best revenge would be to live your life the way you want and learn to keep your emotions out of their reach. my parents fucked me up badly too. i wish i could've had a loving family that accepted me for who i am. but they didn't and it's made my entire life difficult. i was bitter and angry for most of my life. i'm also in the midwest but i'm not gonna find you. i want you to be happy in spite of them. it won't be easy but you can recover from their bullshit in time. if they enjoy making you feel like shit,the best revenge is to not let them do it. i know that's easier said than done. i don't have any easy answers,but i hope you can find yourself and be happy with it. maybe try another type of therapy or find a group that have gone thru a similar upbringing. there are others like you,who have dealt with this kinda shit.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey i'm really proud of you. your wellbeing is more important than grades, no matter what anyone says. a lot of people who are successful entrepreneurs weren't astudents and they are still here, living their lives. the time you spend living with your parents is short you have the rest of your life ahead of you. i'm sorry that they are putting so much pressure on you, some parents are like that. 4 college classes wow! you must be really smart! it's ok not to get perfect grades. this sounds like a case of imposter syndrome. you can't be perfect all the time there are some classes that you just have to get through. it gets better.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm on the same boat. its the worst feeling when you put all your hope mind energy into trying to fight but it still fails. at least you dont have to feel guilty. but damn why does everything have to be so difficult. i was eczema free for 4 years but had other issues going on. all the other problems resolved after i fought hard for that so they got solved and now my eczema is back. now that i was finally happy and content and enjoying life i'm back to being suicidal. i wasn't even suicidal with the other issues just tired. now my worst nightmare which is having eczema all over again is a reality. it's like like being pushed down to the lowest level of a ladder after you fought hard to get to the top. you were almost there and them boom. its fucked up. peopl are thriving and some of us can't stop having glue sticking under our shoes. lol sorry for hijacking your post.</data>

  <data key="d1">youre combined income is over 80k. you should be able to live a decent life even in this economy. i say this in a supportive way, im not lecturing your spending habits for the record. first dont beat yourself up. youre understandably stressed. i feel that. its hard. but yall can get through this. you need to find ways to save money. calmly honestly calmly when you two can do this strategize. maybe the rent and car payments are too much? can one car do? or find cheaper ones. downsize to cheaper rent. move out of the city area if its expensive. can you move in with family for one year pay them rent of course and make it honestly a one year plan. less take out food? cook more including junk foods make a cake or cookies. bigger bang for your buck. find a cheaper grocery store. combine your phone plans. evaluate every monthly bill. perhaps you have subscriptions to stuff you dont use or want. pay less on your loans. ask for a raise? instead of saving money for the wedding put pretaxed money in a 401402? then when you want the money, take a loan out against yourself. you can borrow up to half of it no penalty. you pay minimal interest of course but the interest goes to your own account, not the bank. i did this with my partner to save for a house down payment. it lowered our tax brackets, earned better interest than a savings account, and was more or less untouchable money. then we also had a 401 going youre not alone. its super hard. but you can get through it.</data>

  <data key="d1">its a difficult concept. support doesnt magically make anything better, you are alone in your head that is the only truth. but there are others who are suffering alone as well. that doesnt change the fact that you are alone but we are all human, we all have the ability to reach this place in our livesheads. if you were happy you would be alone too. if you were successful you would be alone. i think a lot of people hear someone say something like you are not alone and felt better because of it and then say it to someone else because they think that person may feel what they felt when they heard it.</data>

  <data key="d1">i dont want to hurt my family and my pets by dying. me dying would send them in a downward spiral. i just wish i could end it without hurting them. i cant live this life. im too weak to be able to bear having a full time job. too afraid and unloveable to find a partner id love back. if thats whats in store for me, or if i got to wait until im 25 to find a partner, i dont want to do this. im miserable. barely anything makes me happy anymore. i just want to die. or to run away, live off the land. but either of those decisions would leave everyone i care about in a bad place.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey man i read the whole thing. it sounds so unfair. you are actually trying to put some from your part in the house despite the fact that you are disabled, and she just makes you feel even worse about it. it's ironic that she blames you of playing the victim when she says her depression is your fault. if you ask me this is absurd. some people are just incompetent at raising childs, it sucs. she's even killing the few hope you have about things you want to build in the future. i can do nothing for your situtation but sharing a small amount of all the anger you should feel rightnow. and i also want to tell you that it's not your fault, really. you did nothing to deserve this, you just ended in the wrong hands and just as it's natural it drove you to this subreddit. this is a fight between you and your circumstances, because there is nothing wrong with you. i might not know all about your circumstances, like how it feels like when she tells you these hurtful things face to face, maybe every single day. but just like any other person who grow up with narcisistic parents, there's still a way out that doesn't involve suicide. the actual disabled person here is your mother, because she's blind to the damage she is causing, and if she is aware then she's not stopping it. don't let this person get inside your head, you are strong, they can hit you but only you decide if they hurt you. do you think that maybe talking with her about how all of this makes you feel might help at all? did you ever tried anything like that? and if you did, how it went? i wish you my bests, op i'll also leave this sub here, maybe you can relate to the people there and know you are not alone on this.</data>

  <data key="d1">ive used suicidal thoughts as an escape as far back as i can remember. my depression started at the age of 10 and im now 32. i only acted on my thoughts once at the age of 15. i bought a large bottle of ibuprofen and took the whole thing so dumb, then got scared and asked my mom to drive me to the er. had to get my stomach pumped. it fucking sucked. since then, i regularly fantasize about it when im having a hard time. i go straight to thoughts of killing myself. im in therapy, on antidepressants, i eat healthy meals, i exercise, i have friends and hobbies. none of it helps. the longest i went without feeling like this was after i met my stbxh. we were together for 3 years, married for 2. it was the happiest i had ever been. i even forgot what it felt like to be this depressed. id listen to sad songs and i couldnt connect with them anymore. i felt joy and gratitude. he just made me feel so loved and seen. then one day he abruptly left me. told me he had never really loved me and that he got married hoping he would develop those feelings for me eventually were going through a heart wrenching divorce right now and i think about killing myself almost every day. ive moved into planning it out. the only thing keeping me here is my dog who is incredibly attached to me, and my siblings who are 13 and would be incredibly traumatized by the experience. if not for them, id have jumped off a tall building already. or injected a lethal dose of morphine. its just incredibly painful to live inside my brain. its physically painful. ive been fighting it for 22 years and im exhausted. its wild to me that im still here and fighting. im trying ketamine assisted therapy next. if that doesnt work, i think ill probably wait until my dog dies and the kids are adults and ill take my own life. i can live in misery for another 10 years and then call it at least i have a literal deadline for my suffering to end.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've had suicidal ideations since i was about ten. i'm forty one now. yes it can just be a coping mechanism. my therapist says thoughts are fine plans are a problem. so if it's just something you do to sooth yourself then you're fine. if you start planning and gathering items to actually do it you need to seek help immediately. i am so with you on the soothing nature of the ideations but do not let it go to far.</data>

  <data key="d1">i definitely do that, also because i feel under appreciated in my daytoday life and its nice to think about people finally showing i meant something to them. its my own little selfish way of coping, but i always try to remember i carry a selfdestructive mindset and that ill regret causing immense pain to those same people just to prove something to myself. yes im considering therapy.</data>

  <data key="d1">i tend to view it as 'liberating leverage'. first though fuck it, i'll just kill myself. second thought fuck it, but actually killing myself has proved difficult in the past. maybe just stop at fuck it. third thought seeing as i have ruled out killing myself, i might as well solve the problem. this is how most days go. i can entirely see it as a coping mechanism.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi, unfortunately i can't imagine how you feel now, i went through a few years where everything went wrong, and what i learned is that even failing at everything is much better than not even trying, even if it takes time and you end up failing, the things will get better.</data>

  <data key="d1">youre right its never a good time, and what youre feeling is very real. i understand your spouse cheated and no remorse. i caught my now ex husband when i never looked for anything because i trusted and loved him. they say theres a fine line between love and hate and i can say ive felt the extremes of both with him. you already know shes shown no remorse, like mine never did. instead he blamed me for everything. i told him to get out the night i learned of it and there was no denying it even if i wanted to. but i also knew i couldnt be with a cheater. i honestly thought we were soulmates and he had everyone believing that too. he worshiped me. he showed me so much affection and love until suddenly his true self was exposed. i didnt think id ever get through that and wanted to die. id never felt so much devastation, heartbreak, anger, and depression was at an all time high for me at that point. but it got worse with each thing i had to deal with getting him out and away from me. there were plenty of things he did that i couldnt ever have imagined, but was like a huge slap in my face to see he didnt care about me. he turned to hating me, when all i wanted was for it to be over. dont give her any more time or space in your head, please! these people are cruel and heartless. get your divorce, do right by your son, he needs his dad! you need your son! all else i can say is that time does eventually make things easier and believe it or not, better! focus on yourself and try to be kind to yourself. you deserve this, too. work on loving yourself. this was very hard for me, and the loneliness i felt was so brutal, but whats more brutal is being with someone like your spouse and mine. were definitely not alone in this, and were not alone in the process of healing our hearts it will get better! i know you dont see that now in the state of mind youre in, but this is temporary even if the 9 months already seems like an eternity, try not to think about that and try to find something you can find joy through even if just for a short time. keep doing this even if its the last thing you feel like doing, do something, anything, that gets your mind in another space for awhile. what do you like to do? it doesnt need to cost money and it doesnt have to impress anyone. youre worth so much more than youre able to see right now. rejection, cheating, lies and deceit are such damaging things to us, but again, it does get better. i swear it does, and i was my biggest problem in seeing things for what they really were. i cant not say i didnt have constant thoughts of what youre having, as i had no support from family or friends. i was as alone as alone can be except for my dog. she needed me and i needed her even more. i went nowhere and did nothing. i beat myself up day and night for being a failure, but i wasnt the failure! just as youre not either. please dont do what youre thinking of. youre needed and youre loved, even if you cant see it or believe it. in time, youll likely meet someone who appreciates you for you, and youll be stronger because of it. the saying is true what doesnt kill us makes us stronger. i didnt feel strong at all and its been years now since i went through the hell youre living in, but you will make it out and youll know this woman never deserved you, but someone else will</data>

  <data key="d1">hey man im right here with you. the pain is unbearable, i know. it seems like a sick joke and so incredibly unfair, i get it. i lost my best friend, my grandma two years later then my mom, who i found two weeks after my birthday already dead on her bed. my partner of 10 years then decided to pass messages with other women, which i found after telling him that him my dog are all i have. its fucking hard. but im right here with you. trying to be better and trying to move forward. its gonna take some time and i wish life wasnt so damn unfair to us but we must make it out of this alive. we must. we have to muster the courage to continue. this is literally a note to myself as well. because i also feel like giving up. i send you all of the love n light that i can. although it feels like mine is dimming you got this, man.</data>

  <data key="d1">sounds like a very difficult situation, im sorry. i think you should keep having contact with her as much as you possibly can. call her, write her and let her know that you are here if she needs to vent or someone to talk to. its hard to really come with solid advice with so little information and without really knowing where her feelings are stemming from. you could ask her to describe why she feels like this and what it would take for her to get her will to live back. we often hide some much in the fog that the real issues often are hidden away deep down. please remember to take care of yourself and have your own mental health in mind too. its a beautiful thing to help other people, but you cant help if you become broken too. i wish you well and good luck. you are a beautiful soul.</data>

  <data key="d1">disclaimer i also suffer with depression and intrusive thoughts, but i'm not a professional on this sort of thing. experience might be the best teacher, but i'm too close to that experience to have an unbiased opinion. i'll do my best, though, and hopefully it's of some use to you. i think the fact that you're questioning whether your thoughts are serious is itself evidence that they're serious to you and when it comes to our thoughts, our own opinion is the only one informed by firsthand knowledge. even if you think about nonserious attempts at selfharm, that's still evidence of unmet needs that are worth discussing with a subject matter expert. if you have access to a counselor of any kind, it's not a problem to schedule a visit just to ask. imho, it's never too early to hit a professional with some questions. aside from that, most mental health professionals seems to use a risk assessment based on how thoughts become actions. i've summarized the process as i understand it below, but i'll lead with a caveat it can be difficult to read. content warning description of intrusive thoughts escalating to action !1. thinking about not existing, dying of natural causes, or of falling asleep and not waking up. 2. thinking about intentionally ending your life in a general sense. 3. thinking about specific ways to end your life. 4. making mental plans on how you will end your life. 5. preparing to take action by securing the means to harm yourself, giving possessions away, etc. 6. starting to take action but not going through with it ie, going to a roof but not jumping. 7. attempting to end your life but failing! again, though self evaluation is a real challenge. i've had a lot of selfdoubt regarding my own depression in the past. my counselor helped my come to a conclusion i doubt i would have had confidence in without her.</data>

  <data key="d1">thats likely a call for help, or hes comfortable enough with you to disclose that. both leave you with options, and both were his choice to bring you into his situation. not a professional by any means btw. ive had experience with jokes like that, serious variations of it too. i guess ask around and make sure hes got a support system, a functional one as well, and hope he keeps in touch with those trusted people. there isnt much you can do. what he did has happened, you cant change it, neither can he. i think if you check in every now and again, ask hows hes really going, howre his cuts healing if they are healed dont bother obviously with that one. usually people who attempt by cutting have likely self harmed before, so you can ask if his tool wasis sterile and make sure hes taking care of whatever injuries he has. ive cut many times before, so im saying what id like said to me i guess. try not to come off as demanding or angry in your questions, be casual but ask if youre allowed to discuss the topic further outside of jokes. apologies if my comment likely made you freak out more! wasnt my intent but i can understand how it would.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah... im 20 too, an artist, prescribed lexapro but i stopped taking it after less than a week, with a boyfriend sleeping next to me. today just been thinking about going back to some sh, but... yup, then awkward sex. makes me feel like i want to blow up. idk, it's a difficult life. everybody is so hopeful around me for the future and i dont get it. i'm sad and have these intrusive plans to stop being here or to run, but this is the best life has been being in real life especially. even though it's sad, it's good to find a story like mine. hope things are not too difficult for you, and even if he doesn't get it, he's supportive enough and present. it's good to be present is all i've learned, makee planning for the future a bit hard though.. there's a lot of tiny things around you that are alive, but it does and is a cope living through that. wish it wasn't all coping but a lot of beautiful things around. i'm not the best mentally either but i hope you hang in there.</data>

  <data key="d1">velocity plays a huge role in success rate. in my case i would have been crushed but of course, the feeling i then feel arent even about myself, theyre about the poor driver dealing with the aftermath, the people on the platform, children witnessing something grim, the hell id put commuters through because i would have caused a line shut down. i really dont give a shot about myself. im not even worth that to me, or anyone else really.</data>

  <data key="d1">maybe our biggest failure is to measure ourselves with the wrong measuring stick. if you're in pain and you want it to end, it doesn't make you a failure. just human. maybe you not jumping means something different than what you think. maybe those tears meant something else, a sign of something that needs to heal. i don't know you. but i do hope you never jump and just keep looking to heal that part of you that made you cry, and to look different at the other part that stopped you from doing it... i'm sorry, my english can be really bad and i hope i'm making this as understandable as possible. life can be really hard, too much to bear sometimes, so don't be so harsh on yourself.</data>

  <data key="d1">in this instance, its not the measuring stick that was the problem, but the handling. talking to some people got me stuck in an infinite spiral. the rate at which attempts occur these days and the failures that always follow them really makes me wonder if ill ever be able to end things. last night i wrapped my neck tight enough to break skin, but that feeling of the head about ro blow up was too much to handle.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know the feeling about waiting lists. the hoops you have to jump through to get care after already having to fight your own self just to admit that you need help is so discouraging. i wont say it gets any easier but sometimes the obstacles arent as hard to climb over as before. think of a giant road blocking boulder stopping me for years whereas now its a bunch of absurdly annoying balls of hail. neither one preferable, but at least i dont have to climb this time.</data>

  <data key="d1">alright, mentally i've been where you are. what i can tell you is that hospitals aren't as scary as they are made up to be thanks hollywood ... when you go in by your own will, you can also leave b your own will. you can meet awesome people in there i did. you are in a safe space and the people there will want to help you. on another, less helpful note alcohol kept me going for a few years till i could find reasons to live. sometimes a bad coping mechanism is better than none. better than to end it, you know? cause if you want to end it, who cares? you can do so many things before you jump. and a hospital wont keep you from jumping if you go in on your own terms as far as i know.</data>

  <data key="d1">you dont want to go the mental hospital. ive been twice. when you go to the mental hospital, you'll realize there are people your age who are suffering severe mental illness that is extremely hard to manage w medication and therapy. not to mention, the beds are super uncomfortable. the food sucks. the nurses will wake you up at 45 in the morning just to take vitals. you will share a room w a stranger and it will make you even more depressed in there. invest in your body, your mind, your soul. become the best possible version, like a computer constantly updating into the newest, most strongest, and powerful version. and kick that addiction to the curb. i want you to become strong. be a force for life. stay here just a little longer man. just one more day.</data>

  <data key="d1">im currently struggling with suicidal ideation and what youre saying sounds like youre actively seeking the technical exceptions to the general rule. i know my mother and at least a couple others truly love me and would miss me if i died, and that theres plenty of others who feel like me right now. in regards to the first group i can recognize their love exists, but that doesnt do anything for how i feel other than add guilt to the equation for me. im sure ill sound ungrateful when i say this, but the alienation factor is very strong when i recognize that the number of people who i regularly interact with is lower than the number of people who themselves love the average well adjusted young adult. at best, recognizing that adds guilt to my feelings. at worst, it reinforces my negative feelings and comes off as a wellintentionedyetdismissive attempt at cheering me up. as for the second i dont gain any substantial measure of comfort knowing that others want to end their lives for almost identical reasons to me reflecting on that only serves to make me want to die more by adding to the feeling that we dont actually have significant solutions to offer for many people with these desires, or it simply doesnt mean anything to me since i dont know these people and they dont know me. i dont think youre lying like the person above, but i do think you come off poorly to someone in this state of mind if your intent is to seriously dissuade. but what do i know? im suicidal and have been rationalizing my feelings for 15 years after all. maybe im just annoyed theres some shreds of truth id prefer to ignore in your statement because they pose some issues for my selfprescribed prognosis.</data>

  <data key="d1">bleach sounds like terrible pain. i imagine it can be appealing to cover whatever emotionalmental pain you are into, but as result its just gonna add up and result in more suffer. if you feel unsure about trusting yourself, please just flush in the toilet. optionally save a little bit and make a tie dye fingers crossed for you mate, hope you will have a good talk later today!</data>

  <data key="d1">same here my friend, a mix of hopelessness, pointlessness, and isolation are very loud feelings, even if they arent true. part of what keeps me going as well, knowing someone might care. i dont really have advice, but more a goal. seeking purpose seems to help. i feel like purpose gives you hope to keep fighting for your dreams, gives you a reason to keep fighting for your dreams, which surrounds you with good people along the way. note i dont know if this is the answer, im still seeking purpose, but what i can tell you is that life is beautiful, and more importantly, orchestrated. everyone will suffer at some point. may be a minor setback, might be a fall to a dark, rock bottom. however, if your eyes are open, theres a grace that meets you at your lowest points. some how, life keeps going, and you climb your mountain to glory. when you look back, you see the beauty of all of it, and you acknowledge that grace. that, i have seen, and will see again. i hope you find purpose, and feel that grace too. best</data>

  <data key="d1">it's worth the battle, speaking out is always beneficial to those who do so. i'm no expert on lawpresenting evidence by any means so i'm not gonna give much advice on thst but you do seem to have injuries from the events, which could help argue the case? rape is such a hard process to go through, its seriously one of the, if not the most, worst things to experience. the fact that you're still standing from it happening four times is beyond me, you are much more mentally stronger than you think. you have already proven yourself to be able to stand back up after being repeatedly kicked to the ground, which makes you stronger than most people i know. to kill yourself, it's such a waste of a strong person who can also inspire other victims by speaking out. i know you said you don't care about anyone else, but wouldn't it make you feel better about yourself if more people viewed you as a hero? it gives you purpose, a reason to fight, a reason to stand back up. you had no reason to stand back up, yet you still did.</data>

  <data key="d1">its not a cowards way out, its just an extremely permanent solution. the world does seem like it sucks, cause alot of the time, it just fucking does. but its got some real good shit thats worth holding onto and never letting go. it will be really hard and youre probably not going to want to because it sucks, but id recommend seeking professional help. medication is extremely easy to obtain and it helps regulate your mood and keep you stable if youre prone to deep bouts of depression. opening up to others is hard, but its worth it. hope youre doing okay.</data>

  <data key="d1">similar situation, but still working and have a moderately successful on paper side business. i am not set on things but i see it as an avenue, i am the most depressed i have been in years and i honestly do not see a way through. having a plan, specifically a financial plan as the breadwinner and failing provider for my family, gives me some solace, so i have been pretty meticulous about documenting everything these past few months and plan to have a organized packet for my sister who i have tasked with handling such things, unbeknownst to her. i dont have nearly as large of a policy, a total of about 450k, which would be enough to pay off the mortgage and other things so she and the kids could start fresh. my policies through my employer and has a 2 year suicide clause, meaning if it occurs within that two years the only thing that will be paid out is a refund for the payments. my employer recently switched plans so the effective date shows earlier this year even though i have had the policy for atleast 6. i got a copy of the life insurance certificate from hr with the terms and all of that and found where they exclude that clause if i was covered under a previous policy. i printed it out and highlighted the language, it will be in the paperwork i leave with some instructions. i have also squirreled away about 8k, which with the sale of some other things i can sell without raising suspicion pretty quick should give her about 15k to get through the first couple of months. get help if you want it. talk to someone. im sure there are other options.</data>

  <data key="d1">disclaimer, self harm scars and wounds are the shittiest thing in the world, so dont try it. well, to me, its kinda just my thing. sort of like a comfort. im not really feeling miserable or anything doing it, its just sort of like playing a game you like after a long day, or doing your nails late at night. its comforting, i guess. like everyone, at first im just really trying everything to make myself feel better. and it stuck with me at that time, cuz whenever i cut thats the moment people would take me seriously. but now, id really, really, really hate for anyone to know this secret of mine. as time went on, it became sort of like a habit, then it just became a part of me. its not painful to me or anything. its just comforting. thats just me though. but ops analogy is on point. i think every one whove self harmed once either wanted some kind of outlet, or just to feel something other than being numb, to gain control of yourself or just to stop feeling. as time went on that feeling might become an addiction, or a comforting act. either way, it changes.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have an odd take that ppl will definitely hate me for, self harm is ok in moderation. i do it on areas that are not too visible, it helps me calm down and clears my mind, thats why i do it in the morning. if it becomes an addiction ofc its bad, and also you shouldn't do it when your feeling too emotional, someone wise one told me, the best decisions are made when your emotions are not in the way.</data>

  <data key="d1">i really like looking at photos of my family and my dog when i feel like this. watching videos i have is even better. it gives me the motivation to go one more day, week until i found the courage to tell someone how i was feeling. do you want to talk more?</data>

  <data key="d1">look.....i think the very cause of your issue is that you try to live for others. im sorry if my comment hurt you, because i'm not a certified therapist...just remember there are plenty more people out there who can help you....professionally. so back to it, yes, live for yourself.... how much time has been, since you took a break, walked under the starry sky, alone, without the phone, without fear of judgement? treat yourself a sweet chocolate, or if you're one of the diverse people who don't like it, maybe a burger. read that story you've kept so long in your list. or if you're not the reading type, listen to music..... and cry, it's ok to cry, grab a paper and list your worries even if there is no point in doing any of this, do it because i said so. and don't dissapear, you deserve to live. if no one believes you, i do. live for yourself. not me, not family not friends, not employer. x200b please live.</data>

  <data key="d1">well, im going through a big transition in life, and im not ready. i feel like im drifting or theyre drifting from me, friends i mean, also went through a failed talking stage and it also sucked, and made it harder for me to trust again. theres so much more. its too much at the same time for me, probably nothing for others, but its everything for me rn, honestly dont know how im still holding up</data>

  <data key="d1">its not nothing. its still a lot to deal with and sometimes even little things add up and make us reach our breaking point. could be as simple as spilling milk that makes us eventually break. its okay. big transitions in life tend to bring a lot of overwhelming emotions. its okay to be feeling this way right now. you can get through this my friend, hang in there a little longer 3 is the transition a positive one at least?</data>

  <data key="d1">give yourself a little bit more credit my friend. failed interviews does not mean youve failed, it might mean a better job is coming your way. dont forget about all the hard youve put in for your degrees, theyre truly amazing accomplishments! having all these things doesnt mean that you have an easy life, you can still feel what youre feeling and its okay. its okay to not be okay my friend. sounds like youve got a good support system around you, are you able to reach out to anyone to talk about what youve been feeling? you dont have to tell them everything, but just expressing yourself and feeling heard can go a long way</data>

  <data key="d1">i completely understand where you come from. i don't have much advice, but what i can tell you is that do what makes you happy. growing up i have always felt the same way. it's sad to say but there's not much you can do if you are still living with your parents. over the years, i have learned how to deal with and cope with the fact that you can be the most perfect human, but people who don't love you will never see that. i also believe that in sport it should be something both fun and competitive. being number one in any sport can still cause you to be beat by someone and that's how it always is. that's the reason for competitive sports if there's only one champion for the sport entirely wouldn't that be boring? i'm not sure if this help. but i hope you understand you are not alone. i see the effort you put in and i'm rooting for you!</data>

  <data key="d1">no it's not. i've been struggling with suicidal ideation for about 5 years and even when i was really close to do it, it always turned out to be a bad decision, reflecting to it later. i belive it slowly gets better, at least my ideation is not as frequent as it was hell, i wanted to kms just because of bad grades and stuff like four years ago.</data>

  <data key="d1">i don't have much to suggest i am a male i took zoloft but i don't think experienced the side effects as much as your describing them or even in the same way. . . but the little i do suggest is not blocking all meds, just communicating with your doctor more openly from my personal experience asking questions even if they seem pointless is a good thing to do like asking if their is any side effects to the med no matter how well known the med is and if its something gender specific or something that's used to treat other stuff that could effect it most of the time meds are made to be multiple perhaps medication not just for one thing . . and besides that day dreaming i was their where revealing myself was the only thing that helped but day dreaming was another even if it's not realistic as well as eating it's not the healthiest but stress eating does help with stress.</data>

  <data key="d1">i was on zoloft a while ago and i havent had any noticeable lasting side effects, but i was only on it for maybe 2 or 3 months. the only side effect from it that i remember was i would have nightmares like every single night while i was on it.</data>

  <data key="d1">i completely understand the idea, but i don't think anything the doctor would've done would change my mind to stop the med completely, so i didn't bother having a conversation about it as i felt it would be for nothing. and you're absolutely correct that i could've asked more about what side effects the med would have, definitely my fault for not asking details, but i feel like this is such an important side effect i almost figured that if something this serious was this likely, my doctor would've brought it up i was wrong to assume that i guess. daydreaming about specific things of interest during the act as well as eating foods i love sound like good ways to cope, thank you so much for the advice.</data>

  <data key="d1">i couldn't get to a public university to study the career of my dreams and my parents don't have the money to pay for a private university so i'm studying a career i don't like. i'm having some difficulty understanding this dichotomy. public universities are usually more affordable than private universities, and often easier to get into. have you really researched what educational options are available to you? maybe there's a public university you could get into, and that your parents could afford.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey man, none of us ever really get to live the life we want. not unless we work our asses off, and even then it's not guaranteed. i'm not putting you down here, or i don't mean to be, so i apologize if you see that i am, but that's the truth. the life you want, the life i want, the life anyone wants, we don't just fall into that. we have to do things to make things happen, we also have to not do things, avoid things altogether, or in the moment seemingly miss out on them... our path to our idealized versions of ourselves and our life story is not paved on a golden walk way with no obstacles. we stumble, face plant, spit blood, suffer, etc. what you do right now is important. when you say you are a failure and that's what you'll be, then you're right. i'm not saying this is to be cruel, i'm saying this as the dude who said that at 19 and that's the way my life worked out. i wrote those chapters before they even happened. i'm in my 30s now, trying to pick it all up. but at 19, i already saw this for myself, said very similar things that you've written, and what would i say to that version of me now? you were right? should've just thrown it away when you first wanted to? no. there are highs and lows, man, most of life is somewhere in the middle. you're 19, you have time, i still have time...but instead of wasting time building some bullshit ideology of yourself and how your life should be ...try kindness to yourself, allowing yourself to make mistakes. learn from things you're doing wrong right now. you haven't yet done x is not the same thing as you won't ever, unless you allow it. don't waste more time than you have to. stumbling and evaluating is part of the process, but do something with it. it's important what you do now. you are writing a story, right now, don't waste chapters if you don't have to. good luck.</data>

  <data key="d1">bide your time and plot a comeback. if it truly is the career of your dreams, you can try again in the future. get your degree, get a source of income, and use that to fund further studies. or you can get into a line of work via other related sectors, then jump into your desired career path via job experience. a lot of people don't work on what they studied for. make some strategy, plans within plans. don't let the brainless world dictate your path trough inertia.</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you, i appreciate it. i believe it a mix of both kinda, but yes mostly because i actually dont want to die. if anything, i want to be alive and enjoy my life. however, at the same time, there are often days and moments where im just like, im so fing done. it is really weird. like i said earlier, i believe it is a mix of both, but mostly me wanting to be alive. but feeling safe in the hospital kinda plays a part too. if i end up in a hospital, i wont be in my own home of days or weeks and maybe it could make me feel somewhat relieved that i was so close to dying but is still alive. kinda like a more painful selfharm. i dont know how to explain it but i hope you get what i mean</data>

  <data key="d1">i dealt with feeling burnt out back in high school, what i recommend is that you do what i did. i transferred to independent study almost every school district has one so yours most likely has as well. its basically public schooling, you get your hs diploma and everything except the classes are only once a week only to turn in homework or do tests and the rest of the time u just do your schoolwork at home, so as opposed to 7 hours of school with many hours of homework its only like 4 hours of schoolwork in a whole 24 hour day in total, giving u much more free time to enjoy yourself. i highly suggest doing so, my grades skyrocketed and i felt better about my life due to having time to do things i like doing alhamdulilah</data>

  <data key="d1">i couldn't afford to study abroad and i lost all faith in myself. i also didn't see the point in studying because i was being bullied at school by stidents and teachers they harassed me, made fun of me because i became the quiet kid and whenever i would ask doubts in class, i was just ignored and richer, top ranker kids who wanted to study abroad were given priority.these were the lowest my marks had ever been in my life... i was also caught with chits in my trousers during and exam and my result was withheld. my parents found out, and they obviously beat the shit outta me. i deserved it for being depressed and skipping studying to sleep all the time. so, i switched schools and gave an entrance exam in the span of and got a 92.65 percentile because i studied my ass off in those 3 months physical examination with frisking procedures etc etc so no scope of cheating there... this is what landed me into one of the best collges on my country. there is a huge superstition in my country that says you shouldn't boast about your achievements or else, someone's evil eye and bad intentions will ruin it for you. my dad told everyone he knew about my admission and today, the same day, i met with an accident... i honestly didn't try to end myself. i have been very upset because i get beaten over small things very often, but that state of upsetness and being abused and beaten became the new normal.... waking up to my cat fixed everything somehow. i assure you, i didn't do this on purpose. and, even if i did want to kill myself, i wouldn't inconvenience someone who was never at fault for anything that happened to me. coming back to the accident, it was not intentional... a car hit my bike while i was riding across a junction because his mirror the car owners got hit by a truck as he was trying to overtake it.. he wasn't paying attention to the crossing and he hit me. i blacked out for a bit and then i don't remember who called my dad but he was there... i didn't get hurt much accept for a couple scrapes on my legs because i wear thick clothes when riding a motorycle because i cannot really afford proper rider's riding gear. i only had a broken yamaha side panel and a scraped, bleeding knee and calf. when i got home, my mom said it was someone's evil eye and that my dad shouldn't tell everyone about my college admission confirmation. guess what, my dad went and told everyone behind my back eventhough i requested and pleaded him not to because i don't want to be asked questions. i just want to be left alone. today at dinner when i asked him why he did this, he got extremely violent and starting throwing plates and abusing me... he picked up a chair tucked under our dining table and was ready to hit me with it till my mom stopped him this has happened before many times and honestly, the metal chair doesn't even hurt anymore. he also said that i'm a bitch who doesn't deserve anything and that i can live pm the streets of the college district and he will not help me find a dormitory or a place to stay even if that means i have to beg. the thing is, i wasn't loud or disrespectful to dad. i just asked him exactly this dad, why didn't you ask me before telling everyone... i told you not to. why? my mom's parents who live with us also saw the whole thing and i just feel so insulted. the neighbors also always heat everything and i hear them laugh at me all the time. my mom said that it's because i don't part that stuff like this happens to me and i deserve it i hate that i make my mom and dad so angry and disappointed. i keep trying to forgive and i keep trying to fix our relationship but communicating because they told me i never tell them anything. but when i do, this happens it's been eighteen years and i just keep failing at everything i do. no matter hwo much hardwork i put in, no matter what university i got into, i know i'll always be pulled back into this dark vortex. there is no point to anything anymore and this incident made me realize that no matter how hard i work to become independent, i will always just be a puppet to my family. i tried calling 8 suicide helplines but noone picked up... i cannot afford a therapist so, i went to see a c.b.t practitioner who is a friend of my parents and would tell them everything. when i didn't open up to him, he got aggressive and forceful i think it is a sign and i should go somewhere forever where noone can find me. i only have painkillers for my injury but, someone said, it's the worst way to go. i don't have access to medical grade morphene or a rope. everyone here tells people don't do it. you have something to live for i don't i never did noone ever wanted me not friends, not relatives, not teachers not even my cat... i'm an annoyance to him too and, wherever i go, i just cause problems. if i hadn't been born or if i had died of the jaundice that i had at childbirth, my parents wouldn't have such a loser stuttering, fat piece of shit daughter. they would have only one beautiful, mart daughter my sister they wouldn't have to hide their frustrations about ny incapablities behind alcohol they would've saved so much money if it wasn't for me flunking in that exam my sister wouldn't be associated with a disappointment she would get all the love from my parents that she is worthy of. i'm sorry i want to go somewhere far away. i used to tell myself this as i kid when i get bigger, big enough to go somewhere by myself,i want to go to a land that's far away. i want to go to a faraway island. want to go to a island that has no people. i want to go to an island that has no pain or sadness, there are no adults, children, classmates, teachers or my mom on that island. on that island, i can climb a tree when i want to climb, swim in the sea when iwant to swim, and sleep when iwant to sleep. on the island, i think about the town that i left behind. kids go to school, as if nothing has danged, adults go to the office, as if nothing has changed, mom eats, as if nothing has canged. when i think about the town without me, i feel a sense of relief. i want to go far, far away.</data>

  <data key="d1">first and foremost, the way your family has treated you, the way ppl have wronged you and no one seems to stand up to those people for the bad things they have done.. none of that is your fault and you dont deserve any of it. your family has a lot of mental health problems. your parents of course do and it sadly seems untreated. what you went through when you were younger with the family members husband is beyond anything you should have ever had to experience. please know that it says so much about him, so much bad about him, but that doesnt mean anything bad about you. i know youre in pain, i can feel it as i read every word you wrote. also, those neighbors sound pathetic and empty. you dont laugh at the neighbor girl being mistreated if youre happy on the inside and content with your life. know that these people are trying to make themselves feel better at someone elses expense but please try to understand you are above that. if i was there and saw them act that way i would judge them so hard for their own behavior and not think a single bad thing about you. as for your school.. please dont give up. it sounds like you genuinely have real potential to make it in life. i know it wont be easy but if you can find the strength to get through this i think you can figure out a way to get away from your family. they dont deserve you. also, after reading your post you sound like a good person. i think its disgusting that people have made you feel bad about yourselfyour body. you sound beautiful just by the way you talk and think so i wish you didnt focus on such a terrible way of thinking that those people allow themselves to reach. and if theres something you would prefer to change, i think when youre in a better environment it will naturally be a little easier to maybe work on that. but there is so much more to you than your body or any current way that you look. with the pills.. i always always tell people dont even go there. its a terrible way to try and do it imo. and sorry there was just so much to respond to with other distractions around me. your island sounds peaceful.. but i think a different place, maybe away from the people who have treated you so badly but not away from everyone in the world, could be a really nice place for you too in the future. you dont have to forgive your family and the others. i think a good way to go about this is to kind of be strategic. so with your father, try and stay out of his way. maybe dont say things to him you think might cause him to act badly. just so that you can get to your school and have your housing and have the best chance to create a beautiful future for yourself far away from all of them if you so choose. and once you get there, you dont owe any of them even another look or word if you dont want to. you can let them see that you made it and know they are still living their lives in the same sad ways they always have while you go on to better things. i think that would be the best outcome for you in the end. because you would just get to go live your life peacefully and without even doing anything to them, they would know you are out there having a better life than they are and theres nothing they can do about it. please keep fighting for this future for yourself.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, how are you. my name is kevin i suffered from depression in my early 20s to my mid 20s. i was extremely depressed at the verge of ending it, but i decided to push through just a little longer i didn't want to let down my family. yes it was hard but in the end things get better you just have to be patient with yourself and keep going one step everyday. you cannot control life but you can change the way you see life. you will see that random events are predictable because they balance. it's a fundamental truth of life that everyone knows but chooses to ignore. i was able to change the way i viewed life. i realized when you know the truth, you will enjoy the good times more and still avoid a bad time when you can, but when you cannot the knowledge of the balance will help you get through the bad times. this is because knowing that the worse it gets, the better it will be, makes bad times almost enjoyable. more importatly it centers your perspective of life. wanting to be happy is just reminding yourself that you are sad. try not to think about finding happiness but instead creating happines. no one just decides they want to go find happiness one day you have to put in work to create happiness. i know it's going to be hard just remember to go slow, small goals at a time and eventually you will get there. i hope my perspective on life helped you if you want to talk more i'm always here.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey kid, i assume since you've said you have 3 4 years left your in grade 9 10, i don't think i can relate to everything you're saying but i do know how you feel in a way, when i was in grade 9 10 i hated waking up everyday sometimes, not nearly as bad as you as i had days where i was happy but there was also days when i was sad. these feelings may pass with time, they have with me. i would give more advice but feel it may be worthless not knowing your whole situation, either way though if you need anyone to talk to or vent to you can if you wish, i know how not being able to talk to anyone feels.</data>

  <data key="d1">it sounds like you're testing edging. idk what to call it exactly. when i've seen others do it before i think they want to die but still have that tiny tiny little hope that someone might pull them out of their bad situation. maybe its what normies call a cry for help maybe you're trying to look worse physicallymentally so you feel like someone will actually help. you can die just shooting up alone, let alone doing that stuff, you probably know it but maybe that's why you're doing it? maybe you're doing it like this because you don't feel like you're hurting yourself on purpose. maybe it's so you don't have to feel responsible if you do die from an od? i dont know, whatever is going on with you, hope you'll be alright.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm 20 and i still don't know how to drive, so it's more common than you might think. don't put deadlines on yourself! that's a lesson i learned the hard way, and i'm still in the process of learning it. life is difficult, but i'm sure you can do it. these are confusing times, but just try your best. it sounds like you have friends, so just try to connect with them and see if they're willing to offer you any support. i hope they do, and i hope things get better for you. good luck. by the way, i probably know better than anyone else on this planet just how difficult school can be for someone with mental problems, but just try your best to see it through to the end, alright? it may suck, and it probably will, but your life will be better if you graduate. that's another lesson i learned the hard way... i hope you don't have to as well.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, not that long ago i could have written something like that here. i'm so sorry you're going through this, it's difficult, life is difficult like this. i know how you feel. transitioning doesn't solve everything, but it does get better. i've been transitioning for years, and some days are great, and i cry myself to sleep on others. ironically tonight, i find myself here because of unrelated feelings, it's almost funny. i don't know how far along you are, but transitioning will help, feeling like yourself will help. it did for me. not bearing children, not having periods, those things, well they don't go away really. and sometimes i still feel like everyone around me is pretending to treat me as a woman, it's a feeling that makes its way toward the most fragile parts of my identity with surprising ease, everytime. i'm sorry if this isn't the most cheerful post, but i do believe that it gets better, and it would be a waste to not see yourself become the woman you're supposed to be. i know you'll get there, but it'll take time. i started hormones late, compared to you. you have time to see it through, it's only the start.</data>

  <data key="d1">there are things in our lives that we don't lie to ourselves when we feel things, even though we can't always specify them. you clearly said in your text that you feel fear and, moreover, that you feel a kind of sadness. these two emotions do exist in your psyche. however, we don't know why. we would have to do a more indepth look into its history. look for a better specialist. i recommend a memory regression professional.</data>

  <data key="d1">you are still young with your life ahead of you, so plenty of time to make some changes with your job and develop the life skills you say youre missing. your life is worth way more than the cost of a therapist. youd be surprised how many people would miss you if you were gone, even if you dont think so right now. if you dont make enough for a therapist or insurance, see if you can get on state insurance. if not, ive seen therapists who cost like 60 without insurance, and ive even seen groupons for therapy. sometimes even just a few sessions can give you insight and help you feel better, or give you an idea of if a diagnosis and medication would help. its worth at least exploring.</data>

  <data key="d1">you say you lack communication skills, but you wrote this post very eloquently and concisely. talking with people in person about anything, whether that your feelings or simple stuff, can feel like mountains if you're not comfortable or confident in yourself. but let me tell you, you're doing a great job. despite these difficult feelings you still made this post, and you desire to talk about it and feel better. please tell your therapist how you're feeling. tell them about this post as well. everything you're doing and saying is valuable, and will help you during your recovery. and remember, a truly spoiled and ungrateful child wouldn't acknowledge it. you may feel like you don't know how to do anything, but you will learn. you don't have to know it all or learn right now, you can focus on bringing yourself stability. each step matters. even if you feel you made no progress, you simply having thoughts about it means you have. you're pushing to be better, but experienced some push back that overwhelmed you. but you will get better.</data>

  <data key="d1">thanks for the compliments, i'm not very good receiving kindness so i don't know what to say. but i don't want to get better, i want to die. i don't believe in any form of afterlife so death seems like a 'shutdown button' and it attracts me a lot. it's an easier solution than having to deal with the trouble of living, and i admit that this is very coward of me. whatever tho, i won't be here for the results of my death and i won't live for anyone if i'm not ok with myself.</data>

  <data key="d1">wanting to die in order to end your suffering is not cowardly. anybody who says that suicide is cowardly, or selfish has simply never experienced those depths of the human conscious. i will never try to tell you how to live, or anything like that. and if you don't believe me when i say this, it's okay because you will get through it. but, you don't want to die. i promise you. death isn't the shutdown that you think it is. to take yourself out would only cement the negative things you're feeling. to continue on would be to prove those negative feeling wrong. because listen, they are wrong. your pain is going to try to convince you that death is the answer. it's the release of all your hurt and frustration, but it's not. the idea of all the things you're experiencing not mattering after death, isn't true. those problems will end up unsolved, those things you felt never heard, your entire essence and being reduced to that pain. you are not your pain, you are so much more than it.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have a strained relationship with my dad. but there is no money that can replace him walking me down the aisle. there are times you have with then that cannot be bought, they don't have a price tag. all suicide causes pain, but yours...i cannot think of something more painful. knowing that your loved on is gone without giving you the truth you deserve, knowing that he thought you would care more about money than love, knowing that he made a bunch of mistakes without your approval and then tries to fix it in exactly the same way. you have not wrecked their lives, not yet. please, talk to your wife asap. tell her the ugly truth. suicide is always a later option. try trying to be the man your family needs first. talk. get a financial advisor. try to mitigate the harm. you cannot lose anything by trying to fix it. you have absolutely everything to gain. please try before you saddle your family with the resentment i have seen in people who's parents committed suicide. that their parent didn't love them enough to stay, that he valued money and appearances more than them...and that as soon as he lost his money he didn't want to be a part of their lives. it won't matter what you write, you will not be able to explain it to your kids in a way to remove the absolute gut punch they are going to feel. please try.</data>

  <data key="d1">i guess i'm scared, not of death itself, but the thought of feeling pain while doing it i hate pain. i'm scared cause i don't want to be selfish. i didn't live a harsh life as others might have so the thought of wanting to end it makes me feel selfish as if i'm giving up easily. if it came to it i want to do it knowing that i fought hard, and actually tried giving my life opportunity. even though i've seen therapist, and tried as much as i could to not feel the way i do, i never did it for myself, but more for my family. yet i'm still trying. just as some people in the comments state it's also the fear of failing an attempt, then having to deal with the shame and consequences of facing my family, and plenty more, etc.</data>

  <data key="d1">baby love i hope you dont follow through with this. and in a lot of ways maybe saying that seems like nothing new youve heard, or know youll be told after saying you want to end it. but please, know something else. no one can prevent you from leaving this earth. not the person you love most in the world, not the person you look up to the most. no one. nothing anyone says or does might even cause you to think twice, but there is a voice within you that can. i know you have heard it before. whether she spoke to you when you were outside taking in the sun on a summer day. whether she spoke to you when you were in your third month of pregnancy and you felt yourself creating life from right inside of you. maybe she spoke to you when you were little and got excited about going out with your friends. that voice still exists somewhere within you, it just hasnt been happy in a while. and thats normal. not everything in this life is going to make sense to us. it doesnt work that way, and when we try to make sense of somethings we will just end up more hurt than we initially intended to be. i am sorry you feel so stuck, and there might not be a reason for what youre feeling right now because there isnt. but it is your mission on earth to keep that voice alive, and make yourself the purpose and the reason for things. things do not have a reason but we can be the reason for things to change, for things to grow, for ourselves to laugh at the pain the enemy keeps trying to bury us under. you are the only reason. and that is a gift we are given at the beginning of our lives. to be the reason things arent so bad here on earth for others. but mostly ourselves. and i am not writing this to help aid how you are feeling or take away your pain or what you want to do with your life. more so i am writing this as if i could speak to the version of me that felt the way you did some time ago. because i know i didnt want to hear anything from anyone when i felt like ending my own life. the conviction to do it is just as strong as the purpose you think you have in this life. and let me tell you though you cannot see the purpose right now, you do not need one to deserve life. and you do not need anything to deserve to live one. lastly, call out jesuss name. say in the name of jesus i have a purpose for my life. despite how i may feel my feelings deceive me. and i rebuke any negative spirit trying to take the chance to find my purpose in this life. you have everything you need right now to keep breathing. i love you so much.</data>

  <data key="d1">there's a word for this feeling anhedonia. inability to feel joy or interest in anything. learning that word gave me a more clinical understanding that i'm not some fickle jerk who disposes of people and activities. i don't know how to help because i'm still experiencing it. just wanted you to know that feeling causes suicidal thoughts, as anybody would if they were suddenly robbed of joy. it's completely rational to me and i hear you, but push those thoughts out and go looking for what you lost.</data>

  <data key="d1">this sounds like clinical depression. i suffered from that for years until i learned what causes it. there are three causes of depression 1 spiritual for example,because of immoral decisions one might have made and a sense of guilt 2 psychological example abused or traumatized in the past and 3 physical bad diet, lack of exercise, too much stress, not enough sleep, etc. i suggest considering these three possibilities. after i began to get my spiritual house in order years ago and to get away from abusive people, what was left was the physical. i learned to exercise regularly and to eliminate unhealthy food from my diet. that did immense good for me. i had energy and a sense of purpose, which i lost in my mid30s in part because of lack of exercise.</data>

  <data key="d1">ok great, so you can begin to address those things. if you have done wrong to others or to yourself, admit it to god, ask for forgiveness, and make reparations with those you have harmed. usually, the most important thing is to say you are sorry and mean it, and firmly resolve never to do it again. also, we have to learn to be patient with the faults of others and to forgive them, just as we would like to be forgiven. by the way, all of the major world religions agree that if we are truly repentant, god forgives us, no matter what we have done. remember also that everyone has made mistakes in life and we all have things we are ashamed of and regret. i know i have! i've found that the biggest spiritual obstacle to happiness in life is not that we make mistakes, but it is the failure to acknowledge our errors and to resolve to change. what stops that from happening is what is called false pride. it sounds like you don't have false pride and you recognize your mistakes, so you are in a great position to make amends, correct your errors, forgive others, and so on, and that's crucial for a happy and successful life.</data>

  <data key="d1">holidays sometimes work as a reset but i guess if you guys have a lot going on a change of scenery won't change that. have you tried to initiate anything? sex and intimacy are a huge part of relationships but so easy to push to the side and eventually lose. maybe a good couples counsellor could help get that spark back? i'm sorry you guys are struggling, especially since you've chosen to spend your lives together. don't forget it's a choice he's made to be with you and he could just have easily not made that choice so maybe the way you think he feels is just your brain making it easier for you to let go. could you have a frank discussion with him and explain how you feel, then maybe he can voice his feelings and you can both work through things together instead of you feeling so alone? also, side question have you guys gone anywhere nice on vacation? did you head for fun, sun, family, historical attractions, nature or something else?</data>

  <data key="d1">it's completely fine to post here we welcome people with all levels of suicidal thoughts and intent. suicidal thoughts generally mean something's going on for us that deserves understanding and support, whether or not we're at immediate risk, and it's often hard to find places to talk about them where people will get it. i've been made to feel guilty for the thought too much to actually act on it yikes, i'm so sorry a lot of people have absolutely no idea what they're doing when they respond to suicidal thoughts and they end up doing a lot of harm in the process. judging or guilttripping doesn't typically help with suicidal thoughts or feelings it just leaves us hurting and alone because we feel guilty for thinking about it anyway. i hope we can do better here please report any guilttripping you see here and we'll deal as soon as we can.</data>

  <data key="d1">depends on how old you are. kids are assholes, and different people and situations only start to have real connections later on in their lives. now if you're an adult, you might have to reflect on your actions. i don't know you, so think about it. though i don't think anything would justify what your ex did, so yeah, he is an asshat. also, doesn't mean it's necessarily your problem, again, you might've just not found your people. seriously, i had the same problem of people not wanting the same level of fondness that i had for them, though i found out the reason why later i missed so many social clues about getting closer that they just thought i wasn't interested. it's possible there are just toxic people all around you though, it's awfully common, sadly.</data>

  <data key="d1">not necessarily. do you have any people you can ask this? it might be better to have their perspective on the issue if you think you're the problem. also, if you can't pinpoint a problem with your attitude just from memory alone, going to therapy might be good. there someone will listen to what you have to say because it's their job. though i hope they will do their job correctly as well</data>

  <data key="d1">hey i'm sorry i'm seeing this about an hour after you posted it. did the hotline offer some valuable help? let me tell you, parents do not understand the world that these kids are living in these days. suicide is real, mental illness is real and it doesn't even have to be mental illness. it can be simply depressive episodes but that can be enough to throw somebody over the edge. i say these kids because i'm a dad and i'm always scared shitless for my son and daughter. i've always been a little more concerned about my son but lately i realized that my daughter is probably feeling more depressed than she lets on. it is very very hard for a parent to understand what is going on in the minds of their kids. you reaching out is awesome!! that's real caring and could be a lifesaver. it's unfortunate, however, that the burden of saving her life is placed on your shoulders. but be thankful that she at least reached out to you. ultimately you are not her and you cannot live her life but you can certainly try, as you're doing, as best you can. if you don't try then you would of course feel guilty. so while she is needing help, continue to be there for her. get her through this. distract her in as many ways as possible. if you're worried about her being alone after school, for instance, then take her on daily walks. go up to the shops and stroll around. go for bike rides. go to the bowling alley. take a drive to an animal shelter. go help at an old folk's home for an evening. go to the park and throw the frisbee. sit down with her and help each other with homework. wash the car together. watch some funny movies together. get the gist? you've just got to help keep her mind and body busy. and then at night when you're not together, stay on the phone together until she falls asleep. emotions are like the rocky mountains. there's going to be some huge mountains to overcome but then they'll be valleys to ease up in and take a breather.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think if we look at it that way then it can be true, i think if we look at it the other way it could also be true. something good can happen. i've also hardened my heart for periods of time so i could understand not accepting anything coming into your life or anything good happening. things go bad for everyone, some people just get lucky longer than others. this is like hell in disguise but f it just thug it out till the end</data>

  <data key="d1">hi op thank you for sharing, it was really brave to reach out. as an outsider it sounds like you are struggling with family relationships. it's always a challenge! as we age we create new relationships with our family. if i can offer some life experience 36m my brothers were my greatest tormentors when we were young but are now my biggest allies. i now discuss everything with my mum as a peer who has lived a full life before me and suffered love and loss. if it's hard now things will change and the people we love change with us. please if you are in immediate danger share that with a family member or if this is not possible phone your local emergency service. when it feels right for you and you're ready it could be helpful to reach out to local support services. please reach out again to the sub if you need it.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey man i'm 28 and also find myself jobless at the moment. been looking for jobs while fighting through alcoholism and losing my support system. not to make it about me just wanna let you know i can relate yeah, the suicide hotlines can be ass sometimes. i've known some of the people that worked on them and those acquaintanceships alone were enough to make me feel like i didn't want to call. i do the same exact thing at every job. kick ass and then have some kind of internal crisis that tells me to move the fuck on. i don't know that we are lazy pieces of shit. i think this can be explained scientifically without referring to any emotional assessment of our personalities. i think, and i'm uneducated so take it with a grain of salt, we're lacking some kind of critical neurotransmitter that makes regular, sustainable joy accessible to us. so we seek big highs and when things mellow out we get bored? idk, maybe i'm projecting a bit i too have lost my family. i have my significant other to help me through these things but otherwise my three closest friends live thousands of miles away with many issues of their own to deal with. that response from your mother sounds a lot like something mine might say. i think it's just an ill informed way to go about inquiring how you can get into a supportive environment in what might be the only way she knows how. remember, we should try not to attribute to malice what can be attributed to ignorance unless it is truly obvious and then go nuts right got the 9 myself, such a dangerous world man i'm so scared to part with my last line of defense but i know it's the most accessible tool for ending things. but i know my grandfather went out that way and all i can ever imagine when i think of him, despite all the nice things he did for me, is the scene he was found in. i don't want to project or create any kind of guiltridden pressure for you i just wanna share my experience to give you things to consider and also just to grieve our feelings together if that makes sense is okay with you i'm not perfect and i'm not the best person i know but i am taking incremental steps to reducing my drinking, to be more productive in my days, to engage in volunteerism in my community despite the hurdle of the anxiety, to talk to my neighbors, to take care of my home.. from one 'unremarkable' straight white jobless dude to another i love ya bro please do something nice for yourself today you deserve some good feelings straight up</data>

  <data key="d1">the truth is that due to survival drive, people are terrified of death. they demonise it, and see it as something horrific. look at what civilisation created because of that fear that our lives end and don't matter religions and philosophies. how we research ways to make lives longer, how scared we are of looking aged, how we pump the corpses full of chemicals so they look plump and alive. fear like that leads to very strong impulses and obsessions. look how people lose their minds when faced with someone who has different political views or how parents often get annoyed or mad at people who don't want kids and threaten them with being lonely and such. now imagine how scared and upset their brains get over someone going against the ultimate 'value' which is life. that's the only reason why people force others to live. that's the truth. because it's not like person who will pass will regret that decision, it's all about the living who cannot stand it.</data>

  <data key="d1">i do agree with most of what you have said. but, if someone is afraid of dying, which is inevitable, why do you want to force some other being into living something that cannot be considered as life? it seems that even an animal has more rights than a human being. if a dog suffers, it is selfish and neglectful keeping the animal alive, but if a human suffers, then we should just suck it up and keep living until the universe finally shows some mercy and then we die. i don't care if people are scared or not, i have experienced cruelty from the human race be it in real life or through a screen. and no matter how hard they try to keep me enslaved, i will escape eventually.</data>

  <data key="d1">your body is awesome, it carries you around it keeps you alive. if other people don't like it that's a them problem and i'm sorry they're making you feel that you're not worth more, because you are. my brother 25years ago went to.commut suicide because he hated his life and school. he loves his life now, he is being authentic to himself and his family. he was bullied and i hated that for him but he rose above it and him choosing life means he got tonsee how awesome life could be. 2 years feels like forever but it's worth it if you get to enjoy the rest of your life.</data>

  <data key="d1">and why should you lose your freedom because they can't see thay they're unhappy in themselves? choose to be above them, choose to know that you are worth so much more and you will find the people whose opinions matter in the future. their opinions don't matter, tehy don't get to tell you what you think of yourself.</data>

  <data key="d1">people really need to understand when to call the police. calling them on someone out at night is how you wind up with someone dead, with the wrong cop. i don't want to imagine the stress you went through. one of my friends in high school had a condition where he perennially looked 12. he always played it cool, but you could tell it fucked with him. everyone was so overbearing about it all the time. i never really brought it up unless he did he had so many beautiful things to say about the world, and i think he's now pretty successful despite it all. but man, the looks people would give were the worst. i wanted to just smack them up the head.</data>

  <data key="d1">i actually dont drive often because im terrified of being pulled over by a cop if they think its a kid behind the wheel. one thing i notice is that people lose all logic when they make their assumptions about me. no, im not a kid working a full time job. no one would hire me. i paid with a credit card in my name, obviously not a kid. theres not a 12 year old ordering a stella artois with a fake id while 5 family members clearly over 40 sit there nonchalantly. what middle school student skips school to go grocery shopping or to the dmv or post office? do little kids typically carry louis vuitton handbags and wear heels? most people dont even bother to have a conversation with me. im lonely because im struggling to find friends at my own level. i have several, but theyre not local. one thing ive learned about society is that people go with their first judgements without giving any thought to it. i try not to do this. for example, if i see a woman and a baby, i tell myself that she may not be his mother. of course, i dont care. i dont have time to worry about other peoplewhat they look like, what theyre doing etc. etc. etc. do these idiot strangers have no life or what? theyre obsessed with me and its pathetic. i also have a major aversion to being touched and most people dont respect this. not sure if its an issue with those of average height or taller but they just cant seem to keep their hands off me. dont.touch.me! i am not your child, grandchild, baby doll or pet. im a very kind, loving person but i have the same human rights as everyone else. i dont exist for your amusement or to make you feel big and strong. if people have a problem treating me like an equal human being, leave me the fuck alone. this is usually what ends up happening anyway. someone pushes me and pushes me and pushes me and i tell them whats what. this makes them very embarrassed so they ultimately want nothing to do with me after that. jesus christ, this world is full of a bunch of losers.</data>

  <data key="d1">wow, i didn't even think about the potential issues when driving. that must be so exhausting on the face of it, but then everything else you've mentioned? i would be beyond exasperated. the stress and anxiety you're feeling must be so incredibly overwhelming. while i know married women who deal with the credit card issue when on vacation with their partner, it's another level for what you're going through. despite everything, you still sound like you put a ton of work into yourself, being so openminded, fashionable and responsible. i still need to make some time for the dmv myself.... i live in alaska, so i have some experience feeling a bit lonelyisolated at times. pretty much all my friends aren't local, either, but i am lucky enough to have a couple people i can ask to lunch every now and then. it's a slight comfort, but it's difficult not having anyone i can truly rely on out here. i try to make time to visit friends here and there. i've seen what you're talking about, some people have no boundaries, they are absolutely freaking bonkers. i don't get it, like you say it's super thoughtless to just up and do that! it's perfectly valid to want to be treated like a fully autonomous, adult, woman, and i really do feel for you being denied that. while the world may be full of losers, i'm not convinced i'm seeing one here. i see someone trying their best despite a pretty cruel and heartless world. the people in your life remind me of the people i was in missouri... i do not miss that time in my life.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's actually very brave and strong of you to still be here and i'm proud of you. i'm sorry people aren't treating you right but that's not your fault, you're in a lot of pain don't that out on yourself. you deserve much better. it likely got worse because you never dealt with it and the longer you keep it to yourself without trying to help it, the more it'll snowball. but you can make it out of this, i promise you. it's also very easy to get attached to people when you have a low self esteem, work on improving it. try talking to as many people as you possibly can and finding clubs and communities that support you. reddit isn't the best place for mental health support but you could try websites like the mighty. you're not alone in these experiences and you don't deserve to feel alone or go through it by yourself. graduation and becoming an adult is always scary at first and it's normal to feel nervous about it because it's a completely new chapter of your life. but that doesn't mean it's going to be awful and you can't let the fear of things stop you from living your life. you can do this and you will get through this, stay strong. it's also really beautiful that you're in a suicide prevention program. death is not the way out and it's not going to fix anything.</data>

  <data key="d1">he has trauma that needs to be dealt with, it's not your fault that this happened to him. i also dated a man that had been abused in the past and sex life was difficult, almost non existent and made me feel terrible, for longing for sex and touch but being too afraid to be a trigger to him. you're not a monster for wanting to feel close to your partner in physical ways, try seeking therapy and vent out about it, but remember that you're not responsible for someone else's trauma, only by how you act with them. in no moment you went past his consentment and you actually tried to understand if you did anything bad to him, a monster wouldn't be like this, and wouldn't feel bad about the other.</data>

  <data key="d1">often we reenact previous experiences by choosing certain people, this way the experience makes sense when they abuse us. to some people thats what they understand love to be. other times the need we have to be noticed can be caused by something else, perhaps an unbalanced perception of yourself. if you are being verbally abused or cut down like you say then its maybe a good time to search for other support structures probably ones you are not used to. and its true that when you are a man that you are essentially alone and invisible, this is my experience. theres some liberation in the freedom of not needing attention from a female but this journey is often lonely but there are male only groups you can turn to. taking yourself out will not really solve anything and the fact that you are frustrated tells me that you maybe want a solution. when i feel that way i always remind myself that i can do it tomorrow or the next day, it doesnt have to be today. try not to feed the monster and good luck, we all unfortunately have to walk that path alone in the end, but when you choose a better route things do get better.</data>

  <data key="d1">what the hell is wrong with these people? i just don't get it i honestly don't. absolutely sociopathic society. what is that monster going to teach anyone? and what kind of demonic creatures is she even teaching to? how can you see your peer suffering to the point of literally harming themselves physically, and then go out of your way to say such a grotesque sentence, and for others to just chime in with their repulsive laughter. you don't deserve any of this, i'm sorry we had to be born in this dystopian hellscape where everyone fends for themselves without a care for their neighbors and have become so apathetic that they tear each other down just for 5 minutes entertainment... i'm so sorry you are going through all this and i don't even know the 1 of all your struggles. i wish i could offer more than my worthless words but, know that this post resonates at least with one person. i hope one day you find the good people in your life that will truly appreciate you and be there for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">can you reach out to someone who can reach her physically? if you're in touch with her, keep listening and let her know you are there to support her the best you can. if she is serious about hurting herself, your best bet is to reach out to her local emergency services so someone can come to help her. it will be a lot for her but if she's at the edge, it's the best thing you can do for her. stay strong and let her know she matters.</data>

  <data key="d1">life doesnt go on. i think about the ones ive lost every single day of my life and i cry my eyes out for hours. 7 years of grief. and i know ill spend the rest of my life and ill never be the same again. i used to put a great deal of energy toward helping strangers because any life lost is a tragedy and it makes me wish i could have done something for my own loved ones. but i cant. anyway, everyones perspective is different of course, but truly, its not such a small thing.</data>

  <data key="d1">i can also relate. lost the love of my life 3 years ago. been in two relationships but none were as close in terms of emotional attachment as it was with my ex. my first ever love, and a gift from god. i fucked up over and over again and we broke up a week before our one year anniversary. fast forward six months of trying to work things out and i was still the same toxic mentally and emotionally abusive person that caused our relationship to crumble before our very eyes. she never did anything wrong and i was the one who took advantage of her kindness and vulnerability. im a monster. fast forward three years and she has a boyfriend, her fourth boyfriend in the same time span. but i still fucking love her. i love her with all my heart and shes the only person im ever going to love, because nobody has made me feel the way she makes me feel no matter how many people ill meet. they say theres plenty of fish in the sea, but when will people realize that the person you love is literally one in infinity? knowing ill never get another chance with my former other half makes me want to end it all. i still love her like i shouldve all those years ago. im done. im tired of living this life.</data>

  <data key="d1">its okay to be scared, but theres no need to be sorry. im sorry for the loss of your brother and the loss of a love that seemed to heal something inside you. theres a saying though, if someone loved you before that means that someone will love you again it takes time, and if it happens to be your ex than so be it. youre human right? you breathe the air i do and see the sunset rise every morning? then you deserve to feel these emotions. you deserve to feel badly if you need to, and more importantly you deserve to let this out in the universe without feeling shameful. grief is love with no place to go, and when you struggle so greatly, you have to let it out. youre eloquent in explaining your pain, but its not something that defines you. i dont know the circumstances of your breakup, but they happen. it sucks. it sucks so badly to fall for someone and then to lose them, but if you fell in love once youll fall in love again. loneliness is rough, loss of love is tough, but remember to care for yourself too. see your friends, practice self care, and more importantly spend some time with your mom. youre human, youre doing an incredible job given the circumstances youve been dealt, and life will not always be this scary.</data>

  <data key="d1">you dont have to apologize just speak your mind, if youre looking for advice id say work on whatever issue made him break up with you and give him a little bit of space. and you love your mother why not focus on making memories with her and slowly open up to her about your feelings? i can tell you its unhealthy etc to be obsessed and madly in love with a single person but im sure you already know that and who cares its your life, if youre not hurting anyone do what ya want. also wether we like or not time makes everything hurt less until you eventually forget about it. but it can also make it that much more important if its done every day. like one facetimetext a day over a year would make people inseparable.</data>

  <data key="d1">surviving one more day is a lot. one day, one hour, one minute. it all matters deeply because that minute more you spend on earth is a mini victory. you shouldnt downplay yourself because life kicks you in the butt and i couldnt ever understand what youre going through but i can see from an outside perspective. i can see youre trying hard journaling and reaching out here. im very proud of you for that, because most people dont want to reach out even if itll help because its seen as weak. it isnt weak, its the opposite. you are being vulnerable with the people you share your feelings with and opening up can be scary. i love and care about you deeply</data>

  <data key="d1">it sounds like there have been many people throughout your life who have acted selfishly and abusively at your expense. that is horrible and you have every right to feel this way. i too have spent much of my life getting attached to other people only for them to do something horrible that hurts me, and i have been scapegoated many times as well unfortunately. i struggle with the same thoughts you do. i unfortunately don't know what i can say to help mend these pains but i hope it helps to know you are not alone. while it must be impossibly difficult to cope with the loss of so many friends and partners, it sounds like they were not good people who would have made your life better, so i would actually say that their absence might actually be beneficial to your mental health and growth as a person. i'm also sorry about the working conditions of your job, i know you said it makes good money and the thought of finding a new job is probably terrifying but its okay to consider it if you think its possible for you to work somewhere less stressful. i hope you choose to continue living and find the right people for you. i know that doesn't feel attainable but its a big world, and i would admire you for trying. i too have been struggling with my mental health as i have lost more friends in the past year than i can count, but every now and then i meet a needle in the haystack and it makes me glad i kept up hope. i hope you can feel this way too with me.</data>

  <data key="d1">its heavy is because of something in addition to you. all of it is something external that is latching onto you right now, meaning it can removed. you can remove it from yourself, maybe not by fighting but by looking at what it really is and strategising to prise it off from the real you. youre fighting for yourself, to get rid of all the shit that has attached itself to you, its about your freedom.</data>

  <data key="d1">i am unable to get a pet of my own but i did have a dog with me for 78 years but my sister took him back 4 years ago. the current dog i have is not mine but my brother's since i live with him and she is very loving. but if my life was gone, she'd still be taken care of. i was in a 7 year relationship until it ended last year and while i may be a loner by choice, i admit i do get lonely. doesn't help i'm extremely introverted and have autism and learning disabilities and so i'm found as dumb or boring which i can accept but it's disappointing. as much as i want miracles to happen, i think i'd rather be dead instead. i appreciate your sincerity though.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm 24 and i feel the same way, been this way since i was a child too. i can't much offer advice because i'd be a hypocrite for not taking it myself. just know you're not alone in how you feel. you're definitely not worthless and you do matter i can say that much, when i was 23 i felt worthless but now at 24 things have changed and they can for you. i'm still suicidal and you probs will be too, it's never just one reason and i'll be real with you that it's not going to change overnight. but i like to try to tell myself there's some reason to keep going otherwise i wouldn't be here on reddit as you are too. the last thing you are is worthless though, here tonight another human has seen your post and has decided to talk, there is worth in that alone and i'm sure if i knew you in person i could list a lot of reasons to why you have worth. you have worth via the fact that you're here too and that you're sharing your thoughts, i find that meaningful because i can relate. i think in today's world with how stressful everything is and how our pasts can be a fucked up mess we forget that we are human, that we're these beautiful beings capable of so much love. i know you have love for things too it's why we feel suicidal because we put so much pressure on ourselves and put ourselves down for it. ever feel like you wanna just scream?? you are definitely worthy and deserving of love, respect and worth and i hope you can find it. there's plenty of worth to be found within yourself and you should try allowing yourself to find worth in other things if not yourself, which is difficult to do but possible. fuck man when is the last time you ate your favourite mealsnack?? allow yourself to treat yourself because you're having a hard time and deserve it. at work today i work at mcdonalds and feel like a looser constantly for it you can imagine my brain was screaming just do it this world and life sucks, then on the way home i saw a fox and smiled for the first time in like 3 days. that's my worth and i know deep down you have yours too. all i can say really is what i wish someone in person would tell me. life can be fucking awful and shit, but there's also a lot of good and beauty and as hard as things get and even when your brain feels mad there's always going to be beautiful things waiting for you. from one stranger to another i love you, simply for being here tonight when i too am having the same thoughts.</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you for the message, stranger. i passed out, but i was surprised to find this message in the morning. i still feel like shit, but i am trying to see the bright side. i smile. i laugh daily. sometimes i think im cured of these thoughts. youre not a loser, stranger. you have a job, and thats whats important. youre trying. thats one of the hardest things a human being can do but youre doing it. i respect that. i love you too. im taking walks, talking to more people, and getting out more but i always feel alone. surrounded by people i feel like ill never quite fit and ill never find people who truly care about me. im holding on though.</data>

  <data key="d1">it does sound like youre in a hard spot, and i wish therapy was an option for you because it sounds like youre taking on a lot, and feel responsible for keeping your parents together. the medical needs of your mom is another issue. you definitely have issues weighing on you, even if its not grades or a place to sleep. its not true that you dont want for anything as you say. surely a simpler home life would be nice, less bills, a person to talk to, a therapisthere, theres a list for you! maybe you do diminish your needs. maybe your parents do too. it might not even be conscious for them. its human nature to think the other person has it better, they can take on more, etc. it isnt really possible to see from another perspective, though people can try.</data>

  <data key="d1">in hell, you are on a slightly different earth. minor differences. people may be fatter or have bad teeth. things may seem slightly off. think of hell like john wick after he was excommunicated. everyone looks at you with disgust. people know what you are thinking and bring your worst thoughts to life. then they feed off your energy to the point you pass out. it's all about energy. here, people still care about you. that is why i am actually responding with something useful. in your own story, you could actually be in one of the layers of hell already. that is why there is so many useless responses here. the goal is to get back out. get to a place where all your dreams come true. i have been there as well. it most certainly does exist, though i do not prescribe to any book's view of the places. my advice, stay here and go through it. you will become stronger and might be able to have your own adventure akin to dant. and then you might be able to respond to someone else wanting another way out. if you need to talk, i open up to you. i have fucking seen some shit. and i am still not done with my journey. but i am learning to share my experiences to aide others along in their own journey.</data>

  <data key="d1">a question id never think to ask but in theory if its a burning landscape of fire and brimstone id assume no unless they were put there to specifically fuck with someone for a demons amusement, even more so if hell is possibly a landscape of your worst fears or just straight torture a demon that takes the form of a giant roach is also plausible, i dont believe in hell though so imo very unlikely</data>

  <data key="d1">shockingly, the majority of people don't think about suicide as an option or have suicidal thoughts. i honestly didn't know this until a couple months ago until i asked my therapist the same question. i said something along the lines of why don't people kill themselves when they have to work jobs they hate or find their lives unfulfilling? i don't get it and he told me most people don't ever think that way and that it's an anomaly, and people just keep going along in life like it's the most natural thing in the world because it is. it shocked me so much that i did some research and was reading stuff about suicidal thoughts and realized that suicidal thoughts aren't as common as i thought... most people literally just don't want to kill themselves. it's so weird to me. i just can't wrap my head around that lol</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel like i'm in the same boat brother, for both of us don't lose hope. i find thinking of life less as a battle and more as a game, as cheesy as it sounds, it help for me when nothing else does. a pretty twisted game yes, but one if you quit now you may end up missing that which makes life worth playing. i'm still on the search, not on trying to find the holy grail, but a life for which i can look back on these times and be proud of how far i've come. take care man.</data>

  <data key="d1">i can completely relate to how you feel and im honestly in constant physical and emotional pain every single day!! i question myself why me?? just why? what on earth did i do in this world to deserve the constant pain and hell im going through? and yea, i know that my family with be so shattered and disheartened if i just ended it. but who cares? its my life and i cannot resist the pain any longer!! there is literally no point of living in this word full of pain anymore. like i relentlessly wonder will i suffer in this extreme amount of pain to the day i die? and when is that? 50, 60, 70, 80 years from now?? what is the point of living when you cannot live a life with no pain even for just one second in my life! i honestly dont care anymore. also why is suicide such a tabooed thing in society? and people look down at you for being mental or weak af! there is just no reason why i should wait any longer i just want the pain to be ended forever and how hard is that? i know this sounds like a rant and realistically i dont think this is what you wanna hear but im not for nor against anyone committing. i just want to relate to what youre feeling and hopefully you can relate to me as well.</data>

  <data key="d1">yep. your pain is all that matters when you're deciding for yourself. i feel sad when i hear about people dying by suicide but it always comes with a level of respect and acknowledgement that what they were going through must have been so, so, hard. sometimes even if we know we can get through it, there comes the question of, why should i? when it's so difficult, why should i put myself through that pain? it's a very important question because the answer to it is the real reason why we stay.</data>

  <data key="d1">i find when people say this, or something similar, they're is usually two main reasons 1. they don't know wtf to say to you. they probably have little experience dealing with suicide, and are just saying what they might think would be comforting. 2. guilt tripping. often because they again have little experience with suicide. they don't take into account the individuals feelings. i can say from my point of view, i hear what they're saying. but i'm also not gonna care about their feelings when that wasn't reciprocated back when i needed it. but yeah, i think awareness towards how to handle situations where suicidal thoughts are brought up would be so helpful.</data>

  <data key="d1">the suicide problem, like the mass shooting problem, is something powerful americans are clearly unwilling to do anything to fix because fixing the problem would inconvenience themselves. and i feel like you don't get to bitch about a problem you're able but unwilling to fix. so yeah, other people's pain doesn't hold greater value than yours when it comes down to your own life. i will say that people i've known who diedsuicided young will always occupy a part of me that thinks, i should have done xyz. but in reality there's nothing i really could have done to change their circumstances or decision. i just have to hope that ending their pain was ultimately worth it in their eyes.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey. appreciate this post. i already posted something similar to this comment, but i might as well. so i'm 13, if you'd like context. i don't think i have depression or anything similar or at least not much of it, but for some reason i just want to do the thing. i don't know why. i want to do it, but i'm scared. scared of death, because of how big of a thing that is. scared also of if it doesn't work, if i almost die but don't. because then people will know what i'd tried to do, and it'll be...embarrassing, i guess. i dunno. thanks again for making this post, i really appreciate it.</data>

  <data key="d1">its ok, we cant have everything and im really glad i experienced some joy in some stages of my life. its just been too long since i last felt it, but the harder things got i have some health problems and they are not curable, my body would degenerate massively as i would age, the better i tried to be. for some i know ive made a significant impact, i just wish my depression allowed me to be a better company at other times or at least to be more of a constant presence. my mental and physical health lead me to unexpected absences, and i never wanted people to see me at my worst, not that i would actually have people to be around, to be honest those who were never really wanted to be around when i was hinting i wasnt that well but its ok, everyone has their own issues and i knew i was too far gone, i want to leave a positive impact, not be a burden.</data>

  <data key="d1">i just want to say, you are not alone in how you feel. i'm the same way. i think that nobody should feel the way i feel about myself. i am not a great person. i don't think anyone should feel like they want to die, i'm likely not the best person to come to for life advice, but at the end of the day, trust what someone says when it comes to genuine suicidal thoughts. i think everyone has a decent chance at having a good life, but some of us squander it. i know i did. but there is nothing wrong with that. i lived a tough life, and maybe you have too. that doesn't mean everyone has to sympathize with you. that doesn't mean anyone has to empathize with you. be happy with the life you live regardless of what has happened in your life. find peace in the world you live in. it will help you appreciate the life you have. i'm still trying to get over suicidal thoughts myself, and it isn't easy. if anyone reading this feels the same way, talk about it. as clich as it might seem, it will help, even to a small degree. nobody wants to feel this way. it just happens. i may have gone on my own little tangent here, but something about this post provoked me into saying this, so i just ran with it.</data>

  <data key="d1">im sorry. it was not my intention in anyway for this post to cause anyone to feel bad. from what i understood youre still young and at an age you have the positivity to reinvent yourself even more than once. maybe that school environment isnt for you, and this is just a stage in your life before you actually discover something you love and people who think alike. ive dealt with social anxiety and l feeling i was different from a very young age too, some people do a better job fitting into a category than others, but at your age you have plenty of time to discover that. something that helped me was sports, and there are many different sports, some more physical others more mental, that you could try. i know im no one to give advises, but i would recommend you to try something and dont feel bad if you dont find something straight away that you enjoy or that youre not amazing at, ive practiced many sports, from surfing to jiu jitsu and im not great at any. sometimes just the opportunity to learn and do something, specially in a group, will bring a sense of joy and belonging, especially if you join a beginners class everyones at the same level. i am sorry again if my words made you consider something bad, and i hope you read this and reconsider trying something.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi mindlessimpress, why would you consider 12 hour shifts for 7 days a week if that is exactly what is bothering you? you'd only be squeezed for more labor and have even less time left for yourself to pursue a partner, or find a way to improve your life. the point of work is to earn money that you can use to do things you enjoy. when i started working, i couldn't do that either, but i eventually switched jobs and now i've reached a point where i have money left that i can spend on fun stuff. if your job or industry is not paying well enough to do the same, i would be looking for a better paying job so you could get to the same place i did. of course, a single post is not enough to explain your entire situation, but could you elaborate on why you're feeling stuck in your job and what you would want to achieve an ideal world to make yourself happy?</data>

  <data key="d1">i think the reality is most of us really prefer to not work at all, but the public perception of that is awful and it isn't viable if you want guaranteed food and shelter of your albeit limited choice. some would say they'd still work if it didn't drain up all your energy and the money you made actually substantially benefitted your life and well being. personally i'm trying to get on disability so i can reclaim my life. i'll have the same amount of money as the depressing back breaking work i do now, but with the energy to live</data>

  <data key="d1">when i was a teen living in a home where my dad and stepmom and i fought constantly, where my dad threatened me with a firearm once and otherwise at least weekly made threats to punch my teeth out, and where i first learned to selfharm, it helped me a lot to start spending every day after school at the public library, even just to read for pleasure or get cds and dvds of shit i thought seemed cool. i would stay there until they closed. that might help you get through applications. maybe you have a library or a starbucks or something on your bus route home. hope you can get through this time, because you really do have a shot at changing the course of your life. you'll have several. and life will keep serving you shit, too. but it is what it is. i highly recommend spending as little time at home as possible, and telling your parents you're studying. minimize the amount of time you spend with them, and try not to make waves. it really could be worth it. x</data>

  <data key="d1">no. we live far from each other. i do make effort to visit her at least once per week but that doent seem to be enough as she starts missing me as soon as i go back home. moving out closer to each isnt option either as we cant afford it, at least for now. and she also tends to be picky when it comes to go out together especially when she feels sad and she would rather lie in the bed isolated from everyone in her room and just cry all day..</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel as though there is some form of therapy that works for almost everyone, but most people dont have access to the specific kinds that they might need. theres a lot of interesting, more niche therapies that seem to work really well for people whove had bad experiences in the past, but mental health teams just seem to want to shove cbt down the throats of everyone constantly, even if its useless or harmful, and then pretend like thats it theres no more therapy. obviously for some people i feel like therapy doesnt work and obviously this theory is a problem in the sense that people just dont have access to different kinds of therapy. but yeah. cbt does not work for many people but my team refuses to offer anything other than dozens of cbt courses</data>

  <data key="d1">first off ctrl alt delete and sewerslide have me rolling. thanks for that . i don't really know if i'm right, but i think suicide is selfish. i think the reason for suicide is to rid ourselves of our pain. and sometimes that is completely valid. if my mom committed sewerslide, it would absolutely crush me and i would 100 blame myself, maybe it's because we're close. maybe if i was estranged from her, not so much. i know the only reason i can't do it is because of my mom and brother. knowing what it will do to them would break my heart. i'm constantly thinking about them and putting myself through way more pain than a person without them would be able to bear. then there's if someone is not in a good mental state. either from mental illness or drug induced or maybe from some toxic or poison. they could not have the ability to think about how their death would affect others, or even if they do, their mental illness could cause them to act in ways that their rational self wouldn't. just my two cents.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time right now. i want you to know that i genuinely care about you and am here to offer support. i understand that sometimes life can feel incredibly challenging and even unbearable. but please remember that you are important, and your life has value. even in our darkest moments, there can be glimmers of hope and moments of happiness waiting for us. i've faced difficult times in my life as well, and i found that what helped me the most was talking to someone who cared and seeking professional help when needed. it's okay to reach out for assistance in fact, it's a sign of strength. life can be a beautiful gift, even though it doesn't always feel that way. there's the beauty of nature, the warmth of connections with friends and family, and the potential for personal growth and happiness. while it may be challenging now, there's always the possibility of things getting better. i'm here to listen, share experiences, and support you in any way i can. please consider talking to a mental health professional as well, as they have the expertise to guide you through this difficult period. you matter, and your life has meaning. i appreciate your presence and the positive impact you've had on my life and the lives of others. let's take it one step at a time, and i'm here to walk this journey with you. x200b i know it can be difficutl. i've been in a place where i hated myself. i've been in a place where i did't want to live. i didn't have family that loved me that much. i had a lot of hate and anger. i realized that i was given a gift and that i can control myself. no matter if people love us or hate us, we can always do something to try to help others. that's what i decided i wanted to do. i am by far not perfect. i have failures everyday, but i will say that keeping the fight going was the best thing i did. i hope friend that you stay strong too. you can do anything. please let me know if you would like to chate more and i can share anything with you.</data>

  <data key="d1">ive felt the way you do so many times in my life im 39. ive always been lucky with having very good close friends and family. i have a great support system and many people who know everything about me. ive had suicidal episodes on and off throughout my life, and friendsfamily are always what has stopped me from going through with it, except one time when i just didnt care anymore, made a serious attempt, was interrupted and ended up involuntarily committed. all that to saythe only thing that has truly helped is medication. for me, abilify in particular just somehow switches off the suicidal ideations. every time ive tried to get off of it, the overwhelming desire to die comes right back. its like clockwork and ive finally accepted that ill probably be on it forever. ive been stable on abilify and a couple of other meds for years, and the only time i want to die anymore is when i try to mess with my med combo. have you gone that route before?</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel for you, op, and i can relate on many points lived with inlaws for several years, even into my 30s, and struggle to find work despite my credentials. i dont think any of that really matters though, because they are merely circumstances. what matters is the story you tell yourself about those circumstances, and there is no right answer for that there may be dominant or normative narratives, but they are not true or objective. you seem to have concluded that either you are a failure or that the world is irrevocably unfair, to the point that you see no foundation for optimism about the future. to me, you seem more like a perfectionist who has lost confidence over the course of several setbacks in a rather toxic industry. thats totally understandable! youve had a rough go of things. but i get the impression that you would want to stick around if you werent so exhausted by your current circumstances, which makes me wonder if you have any resources in your life right now that help you to fill your cup, so to speak. that could be encouraging relationships even with your parents, fulfilling hobbies, or a sense of connection to something larger doesnt have to be religiouscould just be a connection with nature, your community, etc.. if not, or if your depression has impeded your ability to enjoy those things, that is a more urgent problem than your current employment or living situation. its easy for me to say, with my anticapitalist worldview and collectivistic values, that your worth as a person is not reducible to your job or your living situation, but i get that your frame of reference might be different i just hope that youve examined your worldview, because its too easy to simply mirror the worldview of those around us. i also understand your pessimism about the current job market, but i would encourage you to seek out other sources of stability routines and habits, expressive practices, etc. that can bolster you in the meantime. you are so much more than these experiences, and i hope you stick around long enough to realize that.</data>

  <data key="d1">its a lot really. i was very sick as a child and in hospital all the time. so i wasnt very athletic and insecure, which my mother hated and she often humiliated me in front of others. i was very weird and learned to wear a mask, i even believed my own lies. from age 1721 i had a lot of friends, but was so unhappy. i learned about soccer and stuff which didnt interested me so i could be accepted. but having friends seemed so worthless to me, like for what? going out and get drunk always was boring to me. so even though people liked me, they didnt know me, i was with them but at the same time really unapprochable. but i never hated other people or women, like i always knew they are normal and im weird. i broke contact with nearly everyone age 22, and last year again with a friend group. also lost my job this year again because the mask slipped, was drunk and on drugs at work etc.</data>

  <data key="d1">i was way more keen to do it for what, a year ? it calmed down a few months ago. maybe because i got a bit of hope ? i know however, that whatever i do, i won't stop suffering either. i know that even if i get what i want, my existence might still feel as shallow, i know that the thoughts, the worries, they'll never go away. i think that there's a lot of suffering, a whole lot more than one should be getting. but i had moments of relief, and those few are enough for me. society wants to keep you alive no matter what because they do not know any better. they can't understand and that's fair imo what someone else's suffering is like. they hold life sacred and dear because they know that well, happiness and such things, it's for the living. they hopelessly still believe that things can get better for others.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey. im gonna keep this quick, but i just want you to think about something. no one knows for sure what happens after we die, but we do know that we have a finite amount of time before we leave the world. chances are, you wont remember your life, so while im sure youve heard it before, all we really can do is live in the moment. there will be bad days. they might outweigh the good days. but there will be moments that are good. i think you should get to see those moments. in the end, you wont remember the pain, and you wont remember the good times. you should experience them though, cause once you die, your chances to see those good moments are gone. you matter, because just like all those bad people that caused you pain, you can affect other people. the difference is, you can do it in a good way. maybe one or two or there of those people will do the same for you. im a 15m. you dont have to listen to me, but when i read what you wrote, i thought about someone a year older than me, someone that was strong enough to make it through another year of the pain i go through, im inspired. it sounds hard for me to do what you did, but i believe that i should get to see the good moments. so should you.</data>

  <data key="d1">i am sorry that this life and these people have let you down. you do not deserve the hands you've been dealt. but i beg you, please keep trying to survive i'm currently in my mid 20sand was in psych wards age 1318 a lot. i was very mistreated by my peers and family, and it took me years to realize i didn't deserve that. and neither do you. selfharm is an addiction in itself. dealing with two addictions at once is way too much for one person. i just hope to god that you don't give up on trying. it feels impossible. it's the hardest thing you'll probably ever do. there are gonna be times you don't have it in you, and times of huge temptationimpulse, and relapses. unfortunately its a part of the process. you have to learn to get by in order for things to progress. i'm sure you've been told many times about available resources , but please, please just don't ever stop trying to get better. its okay if you fail sometimes. but keep trying. you have been dealt a shitty hand, and have been mistreated. that doesn't have to be true forever. if i could tell my 16 year old self something, it would be i know it sucks so much, and i know you're in so much pain. but just survive, because one day it won't hurt so much, you wont want to feel pain</data>

  <data key="d1">i know how you feel. without meaning to minimise it all at all , either, i think that a lot of people feel kinda similar. i know i do. i certainly fall into the 'extremely suicidal' category trying to do what i can to procrastinate feeding further necessary bits of knowledge behaviours needed. trying to find out the right combination of actions and words that will allow my loved ones to feel as little guilt as possible. i would add, probably although it's been said to you a bajillion times in various ways, i'm sure the person you are at 16 it's a very turbulent time even for the best adjusted of us . so imagine the increased workload of selfdiscovery, low selfesteem, already experiencing all those terrible things you've had to and somehow fit being a teenager on top of all that? few people will notice it right away but the sheer strength and determination of mind you've shown to even reach out here and potentially allow the thoughts of strangers in a part of you is trying to save your life. i hope you can take on faith that on good word of human experience from a guy twice your age and very similar circumstances x200b with the correct behaviours and interventions selfintervened and selfadministered if need be you begin to steer your life in certain ways, even by a degree at a time like a ship in the ocean, a course adjustment that is virtually invisible in the next ten minutes, but over hours and days puts you in a whole other map that may seem ineffectual you can become a tremendous force for good. it is still very possible to set things up so that you draw a real sense of purpose from this life at the end of the day. getting clean is a sonofa bitch. a fucking, insipid nefarious son of a bitch! but from how you've written to us here today, i believe in you.</data>

  <data key="d1">there is no good or bad it is all about prospective. if everything is good then theoretically everything could be bad. likewise, if everything is bad then everything could be good. i think its a default good thing because it comes under unique circumstances like the ability to have life. when you think about it, it is such an unusual phenomenon that cannot be explained. of course there is science and reproductive stuff but the actual explanation of life and this world is beyond that. so to rephrase your statement, ill never understand why life is a good or bad thing.</data>

  <data key="d1">i really really don't know whether it's okay or inappropriate to reach out to loved ones such as friends or not. i don't want to be toxic. i don't want to nonconsensually put someone in an uncomfortable position. i don't want to trauma dump or make them feel pressured to do emotional labor. i don't know if it's ethically and morally wrong to tell a friend you are feeling suicidal. resources like crisis text lines and hotlines and even warmlines have varied from unhelpful or barely helpful to actively harmful in my personal experience. and they can't exactly keep tabs on me and check in with me. but i'm so afraid to be a burden or abusive or toxic or harmful. i don't want to be inappropriate. i don't want to come off as manipulative or impose on anyone. idk i guess im wording everything badly. im sort of scared a little and i don't know what to do. i don't know what is okay to do. i don't know what is acceptable. is it unacceptable? can i reach out to a friend without it being toxic?</data>

  <data key="d1">in the times where i'm stable, i've made room and a process for me to be unstable. i typically don't play many games, but i have a catalog of them i can just zone out in. if i'm doing terrible, i know i can just... let myself feel terrible for a day or two. it's ok. then i check back in with friends afterwards. none of us are perfect. there's always another demon to fight and wrestle with. when one of them rears their ugly heads, that doesn't discount our previous efforts. just let this moment pass. one day cannot erase all of this progress on its own.</data>

  <data key="d1">you are so much more than looks. besides the fact, you yourself are your worst critic. therefore there is most likely someone out there who is dying to even sit at the same table as you. i might be user number whatever on reddit but believe me there is more to life than your self assessment of physical attributes. you might not be a model but i guarantee you there is something you possess that many others dont. step by step my friend. my old therapist taught me that your mind is like an overgrown field. and the paths thoughts you have or walk down are easy to do so because they are well trodden. we have to make new paths and once these happier, promising paths come into existence, the old ones of hating yourself will become overgrown and hard to go down. and the happy thoughts and paths will become the new norm. im wishing you the best.</data>

  <data key="d1">in regards to being built, abs and your back a lot of this can be fixed through exercise and varying body workout techniques. it'd also improve your mental and physical health overall. i'm unsure if this will have an impact on your waist, some people just have a more slender waist. your voice sounds different to you than it does to other people, most people hate their voice. you can, if you desire, improve your vocal skills through speech and language therapy or even practicing how you speak to change toneinflection, etc... in regards to your dick, by the time someone is in a situation to see it or experience it, chances are they are already in a position of romantic interest with you so they won't particularly care. there's other ways to stimulate people beyond using a penis. also, health and fitness can increase blood circulation resulting in a more erect penis andor make the penis appear bigger by reducing fat around the stomachbaselegs i've seen people get with people who have some of the worst qualities imaginable whether that be physically or personality wise so there's no chance you would'nt be able to connect with someone if you give it time and put effort into trying. i think the main thing that would fix a lot of your problems is exercise, workouts and building up social skills in order to feel more confident. if you think you look bad, that reflects on you mentally and can ward people away from interacting with you.</data>

  <data key="d1">get a nice haircut, dress nicely, workout, be confident. attraction is subjective from persontoperson, so youre probably being hard on yourself. if you have a great personality, people will look past your looks. in fact, you may even appear attractive in the sense that they want you around their circles and see you as outgoing. possibly, someone would want you as a romantic partner if they find your personality appealing. invest time in yourself and youll learn to appreciate yourself. i think youre being hard on yourself, as we are our own worst critics, i can understand.</data>

  <data key="d1">tbh i see what type of look you describe, i think, if you work on the relation you have with yourself, you sincerely can be attractive. dick size doesnt matter, tiny waist is a blessing even for a dude, does anyone like their voice ? same for abs, like 2 of dudes actually have it so most girls dont know for boys and other gave up its not a standard anymore. its ok if the back is messed up, can be fixed plus if youre into gaming or just spend a lot of time in a bad position i mean, its normal. people wont find you un attractive for that. i will be really honest, i am quite a popular and what people will call pretty girl, and i think id really be attracted to what you describe. like, nothing was mh no so unattractive when i read that. i think its really about how comfortable you are with yourself, dont be so hard on yourself really !! i home this help and sorry, im not very fluent in english tt</data>

  <data key="d1">please don't do this. i can relate to feeling like my world was falling apart when i lost my best friend but this doesn't have to be the end, mournt he loss of the friendship but there are other people out there to. it's ok not to have it all worked out at 22, its ok to still be struggling and sorting through emotional baggage at the point in your life, its doesnt feel but it's part of the process of being a more complete person. you are liekly wiser and more mature than when you were 20 or 18, to say nothing of when you were a teeanger. your best days aren't behind.</data>

  <data key="d1">its ok to let go and scream, cry, and hurt. its ok to be sad and hurt. to ache and feel sick. its ok to not be ok. you are ok. that makes you human. when you feel this way, i need you to remember your baby may have passed away, but that doesnt mean that you cannot grow new life and be born again. flowers do not go away forever. yes, they may be dormant. you may be dormant. but, i have a feeling soon the birds will start to chirp and new sprouts of hope will grow in your life. you deserve to love yourself and let yourself feel what you are feeling. but please do so in a way that loves your soul and cares for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">that is a gut wrenching story and youre such a brave and special person to be able to face things like this every day. there is not a chance in hell that i could handle it. because of you this sweet baby girl knew real love and kindness before she died and that is the most precious gift you could have given her. there is not a thing more important you could have done. thank you. whatever else you go on to do in your life, you did that and its everything.</data>

  <data key="d1">talentless, skillless, low iq and ugly this is basically 40 of the population. the good part is that we are more malleable than what we think. and we can work to become a better person of ourselves, just a little step, every day, for every day of your life. the bad part is that is a slow process. it takes effort and positive thinking, which is really hard to have while feeling hopeless. but since the idea is forcing us to think positive, think that this process is cumulative, every single day will be a little better and once you hit the right spot, you will start flying. you need a strategy, i actually had fun making one. if you don't know how, or aren't sure how to apply the tactic. it's perfectly fine asking for help. but the positive thinking is all.</data>

  <data key="d1">the issue is that people evaluating us believe they understand what's wrong with us. they approach us with suggestions like, ah, this is the problem with this guy, all he needs to work on is this or that, not realizing that there is so much more out there than what they can see. other people typically don't ask why that might be the case because, based on what they observe in the individual, they feel compelled not to. it all comes down to perspective and how it works both ways, which i believe many people often overlook.</data>

  <data key="d1">probably because you are not stepping in the right direction and depression biologically makes you feel less pleasure. start easy. first thing is identifying a problem. something you know is an issue, and you know you can change. then make a plan. you don't know how to make a plan? ask someone, probably someone else has a solution because already struggled with it. once you identified an issue and planned how to solve it. act according to your plan. knowing what to do already makes you feel better. then rinse and repeat. i know it's easier said than done, not saying otherwise, it's part of the positive thinking to underweight the difficulty. not saying is easy, at all. the hardest thing is to fight yournegativeself to start. because once you are in the flow, it will be easier and easier.</data>

  <data key="d1">im sorry youre going through this. i dont know what to tell you, she has to put up a fight and keep fighting. keep encouraging her, give her the strength to leave the household and be there for her every step of the way. just keep convincing her its not the right thing to end it all in your most loving and compassionate way. salud to you. goodluck</data>

  <data key="d1">hey man, i just wanna let you know you are not alone. i recently got out of a very toxic relationship and even though it started as something beautiful it became twisted and i had to run for my own wellbeing. i really relate to what youve wrote here, somedays it seems like absolutely everything finds a way to remind me of her. hearing certain songs, eating at certain restaurants, reading relationship stories here on reddit.all of it will send me down a spiral into suicidal ideation so fast it leaves my head spinning. i have no idea what happened between you two but im here to talk if you want.</data>

  <data key="d1">man ive been with her since i was 14. im 22 now. at first she said she wanted space. of course its hard giving someone space when theyre the only person in your life. you go from talking to them on the phone for 4 hours every night to sitting in silence a lone. i recently found out shes talking to someone. that hurt me because i really did give her everything. im talking if she wanted it, she had it. i showed her life. now im pretty comfortable with how i am as a person, i usually have a good bit of confidence. i asked her, what does he have that i dont give you? she couldnt respond. i asked again. what does he have that i dont? she replied to me, a cadillac. giving someone all you have. all you have in your heart and your soul as a being on this planet, and they leave you for a random guy they met off the internet, is truly something hard to sleep on. it just makes you feel like everything youve done in your life was for nothing. when i was with her, all the bad stuff that happened to me i just brushed off. my mom moved a few states away with her new husband. whatever. my grandpa passed away this year, it hurt, but i was okay with her. my dad is with another woman who has kids and he spends more time with them than he ever did when i was their age. again, that sucks but i didnt care because i had her. she took the weight of the world off my shoulders and she filled my heart with joy. with her gone, its like the slightest inconvenience just throws me into a pit of depression. i see a lot of stuff online about thugging it out but damn its tough. i go to the gym and i see all those dudes and i just think well one of these guys could end up with her. i see other women and its just like. how am i supposed to do anything with anyone when ive built my whole life around one girl? i know every single detail about her as an individual you could possibly think of and im supposed to just forget it all. hell, i was there for her when her mom passed only a few months back. her mom was closer to me than mine ever was. now im supposed to go get with another girl and meet their mom? ive been in the dumps before with depression but this is physical pain in the chest. one that doesnt go away. just feels like its getting worse. just a tough scene man.</data>

  <data key="d1">i won't go into my situation but what you described could have been written about me with my life. just to clarify, what i'm about to write could all be wrong but it's what i went through so you might relate to it or you might not. right now it sounds like you are in the thick of it, potentially going through stages of grief and depression. because of your pre existing suicidal thoughts and ideations this current situation is triggering all those thoughts to ramp up more and more. with regards to your mental health see it as the suicidal ideation is the problem whereas the breakup is a trigger. i can't say what's best for you however for me i really needed to tackle the suicidal ideation which was done through therapy, something i should have done a long long time ago but was too stubborn to do it. i'm not saying it was easy or is easy as i'm still going through it. the relationship breakup is still an awful thing, and all the other issues that have come with it, again i had an exact same scenario. but for that there is a grieving period which feels like hell and feels like it will never pass. i know it's hard not to but letting that feed into your suicidal thoughts is not good for you. again i say this from experience of coming very very very close to letting that happen. i'm sorry if all of this is completely wrong, i will delete this if this is the case.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm currently doing cbt, cognitive behavioural therapy. you're probably best to look it up as the internet will explain it far better than i could. it's used for a variety of 'problems' which i have a couple of. it's generally to do with changing thinking patterns and teaching coping techniques for when the mind goes to the darker places. i don't want to write too much as i'm not an expert, just someone receiving it. i've had friends who have had the same kind of therapy but for different things and they have said good things about it. obviously this is just for the suicidal ideation thoughts. regarding relationship break up, for me i just had to grieve. i made sure to read up a lot on it to recognise it's a process and that you can dip in and out of many stages. it doesn't make it any less painful but at least recognising and understanding my feelings were 'normal' and i wasn't going crazy.</data>

  <data key="d1">majority of succesful suicide is from guys, this i hope will calm you a bit obv is sad and we should be more emphatic with men . the thing is about life is that the more desires you have and cannot achive them you end up bad , very bad. and if you have other people calling you a failure or just simply ignoring you is a lot worse. if you keep talking to your sister and explain life should not be so serious in the wnd she will understand, a good therapist is very important if the one she is going is not good change another one.</data>

  <data key="d1">you are not a problem. it sounds like your parents are as far as living home at 23. i know people in their 30s who are still at home. economic conditions are awful, even when compared to 510 years ago. your mom sounds like she is taking out her frustration on you. is that fair to you? is that more a reflection of her or you? please stay in touch and let us know how its going. we are here for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">no not every problem is fixable. but many problems are way more fixable than people think. for me, my problems are not fixable because no one can change the fact that i had cancer and the treatment left me without cancer but also in constant chronic pain. i cant metabolize drugs for that anymore so the pain is not going away. no matter what. tried everything. people say choose to look at the bright side, youre here and cancer free. that is so easy to say when youre not the one in pain all day and night every day and night. but many other problems that seem unfixable can actually be fixed. people choose suicide when their pain outweighs their resources for support or help. but that doesnt mean that if they had the right help or support that they couldnt overcome those problems.</data>

  <data key="d1">i made several mistakes while gf was gone at basic training for 4 months. i took it very hard and held them bottled up until the 3rd month, i was forgiven. the length of time and the effect it had on me throughout kind of fried my brain, i havnt been normal since. i started then being influenced after she got back by ppl around me and online into bad mentalities like looking at other women and judging attractiveness to make me feel better if i lost her she is drop dead gorgeous, anyone else will be a downgrade, but i admitted this 1.5 month ago in a messy situation. i had lived with her bestfriend female over the summer and she was very uncomfrotable with it biggest mistake, and i cut lots of contact but my family came and offered her dinner which she accepted idk why, i was extremely anxious, and i was driving and looked over and i was paniced and though back to a reddit post i saw where a husband divorced wife since she said she had the urge to kiss a coworker she knew. the female friend who is not attractivce at all im sorry was talking to me and i looked over to not be rude and thought of that and i was alr panicked and my face started feeling weird and i then feared it was an urge to kiss her. i told my gf this the next day as it was clearly bothering me and i told and looking back my anxiety convinced myself of that for no reason and i cant get over it. i said i'd never cheat and it was me thinkkngg to that reddit post and i never would kiss anybody else but her and then later it was an intruisve thought. she seems to ignore it now but she lives with the friend and i cant get over how bad it is, especially because it was for no reaosn. anxiety is ruining my life and i cant get help because im a studfent pilot and a diagnosis or prescription would kill my dream career. its caused so much pain and i ruined my dream girl from it. id never cheat i love her 100. anyway that and many many other mistakes i cant get myself over and i hate myself, my family has noticed and ive become hostile for soem reason and they dont like me much anymore. same with friends. lots of hurt im causing i cant get over.</data>

  <data key="d1">same. though i am recently juggling the idea of suicide. also, i have a suicide watch buddy. my bestfriend. we dissuade each other from committing suicide but promote early death. we even have a bet on who will go first. we're both tired of living here and just wanna rest. been a year since we started suicide watch and things are looking down as per usual. haha</data>

  <data key="d1">i want to die, but i am afraid. i want a death that could end me quickly, but i am afraid. i want a death that does not hurt. but we wont know if it really does not hurt. no one can prove that there is a way to die without experiencing pain, because the only people who really know, are already dead. i want some thing to just quickly remove me from existing. i want to disappear.</data>

  <data key="d1">people often never care when you are around but always care when you are gone. even if they don't care, atleast they are not grieving. greviances are worse than having someone being apathetic. think about it for a little bit. you should always live for others. it is what gives me the drive to live for myself, even when i have an absence of one. never stop trying, even if no one cares. integrity is about keeping strength even when noone is watching. so when they are, they can realize that you are a strong person and will respect you more. people who are gone don't just take themselves, they take part's of peoples personalities and lives. like when my grandpa died, my mom has been different, but she's back. if she can recover, i bet you can too.</data>

  <data key="d1">if my soul has such a vivid place, then why am i completely excludedignoredverbally abused by the family that is supposed to support me? they have played a huge part in flushing my mental health down the drain. they called the cops during my last attempt and buried me to the head in hospital bills that i will never be able to pay. i have been the family scapegoat for a long time and i refuse to deal with it any longer. ive tried everything in my power to impress my family but im only met with negativity, even when i do something so harmless as spilling a cup of water. family is supposed to build each other up, but that doesnt include me i guess. my mom wants to get rid of my cat anyways so he hardly matters anymore. i cant open up to my friends because theyve made it clear that they dont want to be there every time i have a mental breakdown and its out of their control, which i do understand. the only reason anyone wants me alive is so i can continue to be their doormat. maybe theyll skin my dead body and have it made into one, who knows</data>

  <data key="d1">my situation is similar to yours. i saw in another post you said you enjoyed the gym, have you ever talked to anyone there and got someone to lift with every so often? i find i'm slightly more comfortable there and it can be an easy way to make a casual, low effort friend. as for your question i'm not sure myself, relationships seem to be a big part of the human experience. you could also try meditation, i've found it has a calming effect if you can get in even 10 minute sessions every day or so. you also said people might be sad if you killed yourself who are they?</data>

  <data key="d1">it is not possible. i fantasize commiting suicide on a daily basis. everything i used to love to do doesn't feel the same anymore and it doesn't help i'm not rich to begin with. fact is, human are supposed to live in a pack, in a group with people around them. being alone you'll just end up withering away and going nuts. what i realize with my depression, everything about me just stops while everyone else move forward with theirs. i also shunned my friends away because i don't want them to see me in this statei also want to one day appear in their life as who i was before, and also hurt and deny my family because they are the closest one that i can blame. soon enough, i don't have anyone else to blame and after that i'm just stuck at a spot, not knowing what is going on and not knowing how to fix it. now i'm 29 and all alone with nothing to show. i can't even help myself to go out. most of the times when i want to go and eat at a place, after seeing there are a lot of people my anxiety kicks in and instead of going with what i planned i just turn away and return back home where it feels safe. seriously, if you have the money and the means to help yourself, do it. don't let yourself fall too far as i did.</data>

  <data key="d1">i like to go to the gym and i know a couple guys who lift too. i go mornings at 6am though. its just me. i can only go with them after workwhich is busier time. it would be hard to take things outside the gym no homo. people always have other friends anyway. meditation can be good. something i've realised is life is a game so any risks you take don't matter. this helps with anxiety and my anxiety will always be more manageable than my depressiin i think. when i refer to people being sad, that would be my family, coworkers. it's delusional to say no one would be upset and my family will likely grieve me for years. but im suffering every day and its happening eventually</data>

  <data key="d1">in my experience therapists are a nice luxury but not essential to improve your situation. they're just some guy who is paid to talk to you and form plans to help you out. you can do that with loads of different people. obviously that's easy to say and you need to have someone to begin with. it sounds trite but if you still have family and they're reasonable people then the best thing to do is open up to one of them. it's rich coming from me, i'm pathetic and can't bring myself to do it either, but i think it's the best choice.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah i hate going to the gym when it's busy. now i tend to go late close to closing time, less people there then. it's good you at least know people there though. when you say 'people always have other friends anyway', i know what you mean but that's not the way normal people think. i think the same way but it's unusually pessimisticdefeatist. i'm not saying that means it'll work out or they want anything more from you but it's not an excuse. if your family would be sad, you have some sort of relationship with them. have you thought about contacting one of them and talking to them about it?</data>

  <data key="d1">hi. have you tried seeking professional help? many people struggle with anxiety and depression for a long time before getting the support they truly needed. there are many helplines you can call. just check google. also check out if there are any national or local charities that assist with depression, anxiety and suicide. it is the start of a healthy conversation about your wellbeing. they will guide you towards resource that really help turn things around. it is so hard to fight through something like this alone but you don't have to. try it out as it will turn your life around.</data>

  <data key="d1">very difficult to be without people in my experience. have lost contact with a lot of friends and family over the years, i have less connections as the years pass... i go to free support groups like acoa, depression support. don't have to talk but it can be something just to sit and listen and try to find connection and to work up nerve to share. i go to same hipster coffee shop frequently.....hear me out the staff are genuine friendly and i feel part of a community of regulars there. i know for certain that no one in this world thinks the same as me. i have an aromantic friend as it continuously reminds me of the gulf in values and beliefs and hopes and dreams and on the better days i strive to bridge the gaps and find common ground. i hope to get to yoga classes. to maybe retry the buddhist meditation community sessions. to join more communities and build connections even if they are shallow and just linked to that interest.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know it feels bad but it feels worse when you work yourself into a situation like this over the long term. you don't have to be as specific as mentioning suicide, you can just vaguely touch on it by letting them know things aren't going so well, you're lonely, or depressed.</data>

  <data key="d1">ive felt this so strongly lately, and unfortunately its not realistically practical. i just started seeing a therapist and its genuinely helping. ive gained a lot of insight by looking at my issues cptsd, anxiety, depression through someone elses eyes. that said, finding a good therapist for you takes a few tries, but i genuinely suggest it i only searched for a therapist after my attempt in november, so i understand if thats not something youre as inclined to want to do, but i suggest at least trying it</data>

  <data key="d1">dear op and others i agree with ya.co don't think it's possible either. i, like some of you others, don't think it's possible to live without a tribe. i agree with the other poster, you will wither away and die eventually. we are not meant to live that way. and no amount of therapy or b6 is going to change that. ever heard if failure to thrive. its a medical term sometimes used to describe babies that are left in wards. they're fed and such but unloved. they're silent as they eventually stop crying. then they stop growing and some die. essentially human being cannot live without love. and i don't mean sex or romance i mean human affection, attention, and the general warmth of companionship of others who genuinely love and care for each other. could be friends, family, or a spouse but without people and people who care? well, in my humble opinion, ain't a one of us has a snowballs chance. i got sick in 2010 and slowly everyone has left me. today all of my chikdren got together for my son's 30 birthday. i wasn't invited. when i learned about it i made me final decision to stop fighting the disease. there is no reason for me to stay. i've been 99 alone the last 2 years of it. they've already gone on without me. people cannot live in solitude.</data>

  <data key="d1">i will tell you my story, i am generally friendly with everyone and was super shy, thought that people didn't like me or didn't want to talk to me. but it was all in my head, i hit the gym for several months, bought myself some good clothes, took vitamins that i was missing like b12, spent more time hiking to get more sun, and finally said fuck it, i was starting conversations with random people, making jokes and having fun just because that's what i wanted, not for others. people started inviting me over dinners, parties, bars and it only took some strength to accept the idea that other people want to interact with me, i just didn't give myself the chance. loneliness is difficult and if you want to just kill yourself, at least give yourself a chance, it's going to be hard but beats ending this ride early. if you want to meet people randomly but don't know where, try meetup and see what's near you and what interests you even the slightest, and most importantly take care of your body, have a blood test to see if you are missing any vitamins or any off range result and hit the gym.</data>

  <data key="d1">it is, it sounds like such a platitude but life is all about your own attitude to things and how you take them. being desperate for validation of others doesn't only push those others away be honest, who wants to be around an emotional drain all the time? not me it's also something that will assure you will never be happy. you need to find happiness in yourself and the details of your life first, then friends and relationships will come by themselves, if you want them. i know it's the last thing you want to hear right now but it's nonetheless true.</data>

  <data key="d1">i would say that i've been through this in the past two years, and have moved forward. i'll try to give you some context, give some preachy advice and then give some suggestions for what worked for me. hope it helps. x200b i had no friends or relationships for almost 6 years, coming off of a really difficult sequence of events and subsequent ptsd. i really am regretting the time and missed opportunities that, looking back, i realised i had. i believe isolation does a lot of damage and loneliness is a bitter aftertaste. i always try to think in some form of hindsight, to me it is comforting, trying to think peripherally, and attempting to convince oneself that it will be just a painful chapter of your life. i can't speak to your specific variables, nor would i classify myself as at risk in the past few years, but being able to have people to fall back on is really important even if they don't know your predicaments, being able to escape from time to time can provide even the smallest window of hope into what you'd like to be. for me, isolation meant that i had no escape from the hardships that circle an individual like sharks, the long term effect of that is becoming so desensitised to loneliness and painful feelings that one quite literally loses the ability to truly love things and people again and that takes valuable years to get back. you may feel lost with people now, or be slightly afraid of not being 'normal' to people, but one day the good friends will have your back, and you may even find some contentment in having theirs occasionally. being nervous to approach people is normal, not being interested in having any social connections at all is damaging. i don't know how old you are, or what your financial stresses and career demands are, but actively seeking additional qualifications for my education, through courses at a small college, helped me develop a real sense of companionship with my classmates. i would say that had a big part in helping put me on the right track, and becoming familiar in how to interact with others. my first port of calls would be, on top of whatever therapy you can get, to try a book group if you're interested in books, gym, become a regular at a coffee shopcaferestaurant and make conversation with a staff member that you like, take a cooking course, join an amateur sports teamrunning club. if possible, have your family over for dinner, try dating apps if you can endure them! i made a lot of friends when travelling across north america as a european, maybe a potential trip? etc etc, i could give you all the mundane suggestions in the world but the tldr is essentially no don't give people up, because at the very least they can provide fragments of happiness in what can otherwise feel like a shattered world. x200b</data>

  <data key="d1">hello. i'm sorry to hear that you are having trouble finding someone to talk to and are feeling lonely. it can be difficult to get help when you're young. to find new friends, i wonder if there are different clubs at your school that you can try out. even if nothing sounds interesting to you, you might try it anyway. maybe you will become interested, and either way, maybe you will meet some friends that don't seem fake. to find help with your emotions and mental health, you might see if your school has a psychologist or psychiatrist you can talk to. it sounds like you need to talk to someone about your parents, the way they treat you and the way that makes you feel. if your school doesn't have someone you can see, you might try to find a youth shelter and talk to them. i'm not suggesting you live there if you don't have to, but they might have a list of mental health resources. i'm sorry your parents aren't giving you the love you need and deserve, and i hope you can find someone to listen and help.</data>

  <data key="d1">being sent forcibly to a psych ward can make life much worse for him. at least it did for me. it also stays on your record and can affect some careers and life insurance. not to mention the huge bill. i think it would be better to go over to where he is yourself. calling emspolice should be a last resort.</data>

  <data key="d1">this is...a very delicate situation that i hope other people will chime in on with other viewpoints. on one hand, if you call cops on him and he was just drunk and stupid, he will probably not want to talk to you again about any of his problems for fear of you calling the police. so you know his friend he's going to hang out with? is he good friends with him, enough that the friend would know he was depressed? you could ask his friend to keep a close eye on him, but ask him to not tell your boyfriend you said anything, the friend would hopefully understand. is there any way you can have his friends keep eyes on him without letting your boyfriend know you asked?</data>

  <data key="d1">i've never been on meds, i have asked before but i got turned down for being too young. i have a few hobbies, airsoft, embroidery, cooking, photography, drawing ect, and i don't really put much time into them, i wish i would though. i don't have many friends, two to be exact, one lives abroad and the other still goes to my school, so we don't talk often. relationshipwise, i just got out of something that turned abusive, i'm still plagued a bit because he still tries to talk, and it always ends up with him yelling at me.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey there, this is a bit of my story. i copied pastededited it from one of my post. i was trapped by fear and still am but not to the same degree as i was before so i think that's progress. back in 2016 when my social anxiety and drug abuse was at its peak, i considered suicide on several counts. at the time i wrote to myself killing myself is not an easy way out. i'd miss out on so many potentially fun times and other memorable experiences and people are what they experience, want to change? change what you do. x200b i was suffering from social anxiety which led to a deep depression at the time. i had a tendency of gravitating towards short term pleasures since i lost interest in the things life has to offer. x200b i'm confident that the symptoms i experience now are from excessive masturbation, porn usage and substance abuse. in general an abuse of my dopamine reward system. x200b symptoms brain fog, chronic fatigue, poor memory, social anxiety, lack of motivation. x200b i have explored my mind trying to find answers both sober and on lsd, asking why certain things came to be. i wrote my life encounters down and deciphered possible causes for my issues. i uncovered that the roots of my problem began when i was around 1415 years old, with things that i am not proud to talk about, in fact scared to talk about for fear of hate. i have told 2 people in my life, i remember both counts so clearly. i then began to forgive myself and reassured myself that people can change. people are what they experience, want to change? change what you do. x200b so here i am 3 years from that peak, progress has been very slow and i've gone back to those bad habits several times. now is my longest streak away from everything that i deem non constructive towards the life i truly want. it's serving more as an experiment for the current time. x200b i stopped watching tv drinking coffeemasturbatingporngamingunnecessary internet usagesurfing through social apps....at first i felt numb and had no idea what to do with myself so i stayed in bed most of the day for almost 5 days. i then got really bored of staying in bed so i cleaned my room and started doing some house chores and started to read a book i had lying around. that then continued for a couple days. around day 8 i noticed my energy levels were higher than usual and this continued onto day 9 and 10. i then went for a run on the morning of day 10, i was so unfit haha. i also cried randomly as i started to think about what if my dad and mum died. x200b i still have terrible brain fog, like being 23 beers in all day every day, but my energy levels have increased dramatically. after being house locked for a while, i saw a friend and that interaction told me i was on the right path. it felt so good to talk and i found it easy to laugh, note i never really laughed before unless it was dark humor.</data>

  <data key="d1">i don't expect anyone to see this i saw it. yours is a tricky story because of that nameless drug you were taking. you didn't use any words that sounded like it just got you high, like a narcotic. could it have been an antidepressant? and if it was an antidepressant, that's certainly hopefully. if your brain isn't producing the right chemical cocktail right now, it's not your fault that you need help. it's 746am where i am. make a doctor's apt today for asap. be very candid about how you're feeling. tell himher that you need help. consider being honest about that drug. unless you know it was a narcotic, then they won't entertain any of that talk. i've never been able to advocate for therapy, personally. therapy is something for after you've achieved some kind of balance as they seem to be the most unregulated, harmful form of health care that's pushed unto us. please make an appointment today. keep your head above water.</data>

  <data key="d1">is it possible to get used to suicidal thoughts and learn to cope with them so you don't feel the need to act on them? x200b i'd say if you are still going, then you are proof that it is! i've felt this way on and off my entire life, it's all about finding that golden coping mechanism. for a large part of my life that was smoking, drinking and gambling. for a brief period it was self harm. more recently it's family and career those are definitely the healthier options! everyone finds their own coping mechanisms. sometimes we need professional help to get there i certainly did, sometimes friends family strangers help us get there. not many people do it without help. x200b do you want to elaborate more about what you are feeling? maybe someone here will have an answer that speaks to you?</data>

  <data key="d1">i can't help much without knowing much more about your situation so you can see some of the stuff my therapist suggested. for me at least, the meds i'm on right now work, so it might be different? what i did is really the tumblrtm way of doing things and it worked for a while. try to make your thoughts more like a person. someone that you can be mean to, tell to shut up. like imagine a karentm, the entitled bitchy christian mother of 5 crotch goblins who are a neighborhood menace. sometimes you can feel a little better by just being mean to a fictional person! find a good podcast to listen to so the silence doesn't hurt. rearrange the things in your space to make your brain work on something other than suicidal thoughts. find a hobby that will give you something after a short while. if you can, maybe bakingcooking can be a viable distraction. even drawingpaintingwriting to vent. coping mechs are an integral part to recovery. you just need to find a combination that works for you. this is really something your therapist needs to help you with. bring it up at your next session.</data>

  <data key="d1">youve been through so much. please go easy on yourself my friend. youre also an incredible writer. the fact that you are concerned that what you wrote could be incoherent goes to show that you are indeed too hard on yourself, considering how eloquent and vivid the paragraphs were. youre not a worthless person. the world absolutely would not be better off without you. this loveless culture has unfortunately instilled within us the idea that human beings are a means to an end, and not an end within themselves. it would have us believe that what gives a person worth and value is what they can produce, how they look, what they bring back, their charm, etc. this is not how it ought to be. human beings have immeasurable worth and value simply because they are living, breathing human beings regardless of their struggles, regardless of the ways in which they fall short, regardless of their mistakes. they are made in the very image of god, have inherent worth and deserve love. when i learned to see the world in this way, a heavy weight was taken off me and i stopped putting so much pressure on myself to live up to other peoples distorted expectations of what makes a good human. i put less weight on other peoples insults and criticisms i can relate to your memory of your classmates telling you that you make no sense. in high school i would be told to shut up every time i tried to say something and in college i once overheard people saying that there was something physical wrong with me. because they stem from a corrupt and loveless worldview. i pity them now, as those words go to show that they indeed do not know the things that would make for peace in their lives and in the world. anywho, is there anything you love doing? a past time that brings you joy and fulfillment? where are you at now? still in school?</data>

  <data key="d1">damn. that sounds so hard, i'm sorry, op. it seems you really need medical attention, and can't because of insurance. is there any chance you will have access to that soon again? i'm so sorry your loved ones haven't been able to back up what they say with actions. you deserve to be unconditionally loved, and i hope you truly are and come to realize that soon, even though things seem to fall through. humans are imperfect and love imperfectly. know i'm here if you need anything that i can provide. i'm wishing you the best.</data>

  <data key="d1">for ease of reading, because it is interesting t.s. eliot philosophizes in the four quartets a positively introspective piece of poetry! that the individual standing on the platform is not the same sitting on the train, watching the world fly by. this evokes the feeling of those two states of mind idling about, worrying that you may have reached the wrong platform at the wrong time, will that infant ever stop crying? why is that man looking at me that way? but once you are nestled in your seat, gaining momentum although you sit still, you can comfortably watch the scenery change before you! when you are in distress, your chemical makeup is quite different than when you are relaxed you may as well be a completely different person and you find it difficult to recognize the body looking back at you in the mirror, that it isn't a true representation of the ethereal soul of consciousness swimming through the neurons of your brain. the rain itself makes no sound, but the leaf is the first to answer. the most beautiful sound that needs no translation. your thoughts and feelings are much the same specific to yourself and as such are subject to the inconvenience of language. you have to translate what you think and feel in order to communicate them to others so that they may understand that which may never be understood. you are the most complex system of processes, you see, and the universe exists only because you have the sensation of existence in it. when you see or think about something that may hurt you, you let it control your senses in that moment. it hasn't happened yet, but you can't help but let it terrorize your mind with the sensation of what that pain would feel like. you have effectively manufactured a standing wave, or a feedback loop, of conscious thought and can't help but let that thought oscillate forever in your mind until it passes like wind or your stream of consciousness takes you a little further down the river where other experiences lie. anxiety is one form of alertness, it constrains the muscles behind the eyes, narrowing your vision and confining your perception to the terror of that one, median, hangup. anxiety focuses your mind in one direction, that is the incorrect path because in that state you are most vulnerable to an attack from any other direction than the one you are fixed upon. inhale from the nose allowing your belly to expand with your breath as a baby does when sleeping, a trick lost on most adults who are now shallow breathers. let your shoulders fall, take notice of the inside of your eyelids. is it flesh tone like the inside of the womb? is it blue like the vast sky? in this relaxed state, your brain in receiving more oxygen allowing you to think more clearly and your peripheral vision is heightened. this is a new state of awareness, one in which you are now like an empty vessel prepared to receive whatever may come from any direction and act accordingly. this is the first step toward achieving zen, although the zen that is spoken of is not the true zen because therefore, zen is like the rain which needn't be translated. it is purely a state of being. so, don't let your past self or selves dictate too much who are are now happening, being. you are the fruit of the universe's efforts to achieve this thing higher consciousness, so that it may understand itself. you are, in effect, the universe at large reality being the grandest game there is, and you are the most worthy player whether you know it yet or not. peace.</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you for reformatting this! i'm a musician first and formost. a punk band i was in was scheduled to open for the toasters, a semiprolific ska band of the '80's, but all of my band mates moved off to college before the show date. i was left behind, listless, and moved to seattle with my partner at the time to hopefully make something of a solo music career. what i got was a day job and a relationship that tested my conception of unconditional love. i had a tough time dealing with my partner's idolatry and infatuation with fictional characters i couldn't compete with. i invaded their privacy and found a conversation in which they confessed that they would give themselves up to this soandso actor and i couldn't deal with the thought that i wasn't enough. on top of a frustrating lack of time to dedicate myself to my love of music and my benign, even vapid occupation in customer service destroyed my desire to live to see another day that i may produce content. i have no family that cares to know if i'm still alive. no friends whose shoulders i can bury my bawling eyes in. i don't have a partner with whom at least i have a purpose in life. i feel myself getting closer every day to resting my head on a railroad track, or perhaps huffing so much nitrous that i won't feel the shock of the toaster in the bathtub or the grip of the rope around my neck. i just keep grtting older and less relevant and so disappears any hope that i will make anything of myself as an artist.</data>

  <data key="d1">ah, thank you for not being offended that i reformatted it. i think i've heard of the toasters before, or, if not, i have and odd enough taste in music that anything feels familiar. can i ask, why punk? that has a pretty specific scene, if isolated me has been told right. have you had any chances like this before, for the opening, while it hasn't panned out it seems kinda cool and with another band something like that might happen again. although, that doesn't help that these people were bandmates and friends. sorry that it didn't pan out. and your ex sounds unhealthy, that is not your fault to not met standards that probably aren't even consistent.</data>

  <data key="d1">my friends and i were all in band andor orchestra through high school so were classically intraining musicians but got together because the lyrical sentiment of the groups we were listening to resonated with us who were on the fringe of school, society, and mental health most heavily in my case. although opening for an international touring band didn't happen, we still got to perform at smaller venues a handful of times and even won first at a couple battle of the bands competitions. here in seattle i became involved with a nonprofit, allages venue on their team of live aound engineers but my mania drove me out of there and i haven't been back in a long while. i always daydream about meetimg more dedicated musicians and making something we can really be proud of, but it's like i've been chasing the ghost of that perfect group we had so many years ago that nothing feels quite right anymore. i did some research and found your poem, about being in hospital, and really enjoyed it, you should keep it up!</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, sorry for . . . huh, i thought it was only a day not two. wow. sorry for not responding right off awayquicker. can i ask what types of lyrics you guys did for mental health, that sounds very interesting? i honestly do hope that you met somebody who wants to pursue the same thing, but even just a person who supports it or people who don't mind you talking about it seem pretty awesome. i know, i'm the most educated person in my family, and that means i never get to talk about random interesting stuff including mental health which just drains the energy to do it. also, can i ask . . . i 'lost' that poem you mention, although i kinda recall it i think i intentionally lost it because i hate people reading what i write and was wondering if you could share it with me, again. i'd really appreciate it. that aside, you value music, you value passion, you value mental health what else are you up to. i mean, not just once because of mania, i suppose. i'm also sorry that my reply to you isn't better, isn't much more than offering sympathy and somebody to talk to. just know i'm offering it because i actually care about a stranger on the internet, a specific one, who's actually shared a piece of work i should also comment on instead of just reformat now that i think about it. i'll do that later todayearly tomorrow. i'd like to know though which part of all of it resonated the most with you? the focus on physical sensations, even anxiety, actually makes me feel more connected and calm, rather than general disconnect.</data>

  <data key="d1">right, i was about to reply to the original post! or, was going to. about makes it sound too immediate when, as it turns out, i'm horrible at keeping track of time. which is ironic given what the piece is about. i find two things really interesting, first, that the past doesn't exist. but it ripples, so i can't go and just write off things i know still have an impact. the past not existing, presently, because things need to exist presently to exist. it's part of the definition, if it's not present it existed. am i supposed to take from that that one should live in the moment? also, i suppose it's also weird than that there are so many ways to not live in the moment, like letting anxiety take control. it's like you're not really existing at all then, which kinda does lend authenticity to just how much an impact anxiety can have. x200b</data>

  <data key="d1">words cant describe how happy i am. your friends, especially abby, sound like your core, people youll never forget, even as you grow older. i would encourage you to keep these people close, but also i would encourage you to branch out, and find more people that show you the same kind of unconditional love that your friends have for you. just remember so many people feel the way you feel, and it isnt so lonely when you do what you want. im not sure about your economic situation, but regardless, im ecstatic that you havent killed yourself. my door is always open to you, friend. s</data>

  <data key="d1">hey bro. honestly i thought you were me just by reading this. trust me, i have the same social awkwardness and anxiety as you do. im not sure if this is exactly how you feel, but sometimes i feel like im not capable of loving. youre kinda lucky, i wish i had someone to trust. but honestly. honestly maybe you need to take some time to think about numero uno and what he wants instead of how other people will react. i sound horrible but i think its true. are you doing what you want bro? is what you have what you want? if you really think your gf loves you and you guys have a future together i think you need to be a man and do it at least for her and im sorry for being rude but as a 20 year old male as well... well i think we should at least legally get hammered first before we go too far ya know? and for the record i never once considered you a waste of time</data>

  <data key="d1">it really is a very isolating path of thoughts, and its one of those that tends to get worse the longer you follow it. i think it can help to keep in mind that theres still others with you, be it family, your partner or sometimes just your cat. theyll never really understand all your thoughts, maybe because they cant, maybe you dont want to push it onto them, but theyre still with you in this. even some random internet strangers not saying you owe others for that, just that thoughts like those can tie your brain into multiple knots at once, and its hard to say what relationships even are when that happens really hope you can find a way to make some small sense of it</data>

  <data key="d1">thanks for the kind words. honestly i don't know what i want and that's the worst part. most of day i try to keep my mind busy just to not think about troublesome stuff or things that just send me into a state where i just start freaking out internally. when it come to me and my gf though...things get even more complicated. i liked her a lot while we were in highschool when we started dating but now that we are living together she has become so obnoxious and drives me crazy sometimes with my pet peeves. for example i can't stand it when people chew with their mouths open, which she constantly does despite me telling her how annoying it is, or how she acts like she knows it all and when you call her out on her bs she still says she is right. i wouldn't even know how to end it with her because that would cause a lot of complications, i will get back to my old self where i was even more depressed and insecure since i've put on a bit of weight since we got together. overall my life is a mess right now and i am so dumb and lazy that i have no idea how to fix it. sorry for venting so much</data>

  <data key="d1">even though i'm nowhere near that point in life yet to even be married, i know divorce can be tough on the family. however not having a father figure would increase the risk of the kids potentially developing a mental disorder of their own or becoming more rebellious. but just because people in your family don't support you doesn't mean you have to end it. i understand you were in love, but were there things that she did that might seem a little bit off?</data>

  <data key="d1">you make some great points. maybe one of the operating principles of society is that life is worth living. a psychologist in the 70s wrote a book called the denial of death that discusses how, to assuage our anxiety about dying, the world strives to create things and concepts that will survive bodily death. your feelings are valid about feeling bored and wanting out. acknowledging the difficulties is part of living authentically. i read recently that it is in this realm where the soul is able to endure a challenge, and to experience realizations. fuck it. that's all i can say. you could turn this attitude into a way of living, rather than a way of dying. in taoism, it might be called wu wei an attitude of genuine nonaction, motivated by a lack of desire to participate in human affairs. so life happens and flows like a river, but we don't get bent out of shape trying to create dams and control it. x200b x200b</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm not sure the evidence between emotional blunting and ssri's are concrete. i'm on ssri's and i can't function without them. i would much rather a smaller range of emotions than constant despondance. i think that's sort of the point of antidepressants. without blunting emotions they can't really do anything for bad depression. i hope you're ok, it's sad when we think the only option left to us is death. pills don't fix the problem, but they certainly make life more bearable.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes. it seems like that, people cannot seem to deal with the emotions. perhaps you should open up to other friends... but remember that can come bite you in the ass. some people cannot seem to understand what help real help is like. and some are content to just feel like they are helping and then leave.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes, i have no desire to open up to other friends. for one thing, i don't really have any. the people i work with are mostly cool, but if i said anything to them about killing myself they would be like, you just need to get over it. the only other person i've said anything to was nice and did actually check on me the next day, but i haven't heard from her since and she never offered to do anything with me. on the other hand, when her boyfriend cut off all communication with her for no reason, i took her to the movies. it's like i bend over backwards for people and try to reach out to anyone i know is hurting, but no one ever has shown me the same caring.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes. i've been there. i still am. surrounded by people, yet very much alone. being a lone wolf is cool when you choose it, not when you are forced into the role. my own family's belief about depression they don't know about me is that it is cured by alcohol and medicinal weed. and then you just get over it. as if it were that simple... you'll find that most people here are shattered souls, we are all willing to listen... if you were to kill yourself today you might miss someone willing to actually help tomorrow... each day is a a struggle and i could tell you it gets easier but that never resonates with me. if you care about this friend who wants to help, i'd advise you to remind him that your feelings are less convenient to you than they are to him. and that you don't want him to help if it is too hard for him. sometimes it is better that people that put rules on your emotions and how much they can handle are not involved, they'll get flighty soon enough as you explore the depth of your feelings...</data>

  <data key="d1">when you're depressed or have a psychological disorder, having a long life isn't always a wanted aspiration. think about it like having to stay at work nearly 247, no breaks and whenever it seems like you're nearly done with a huge task, your boss dumps more work on your shoulders. its exhausting to deal with. its even more exhausting and lonely when you either are, or feel like you're going through it alone, with no moral support. helping others is awesome, but it doesn't cure depression.</data>

  <data key="d1">suicide notes are evidence in a homicide. the police follow their internal policies on whether or not to release any information from it. this can be anything from keeping it in an evidence locker and never releasing it to anyone to releasing it to the public. a lot of times, it depends on the celebrity of the person. the more famous, the more likely the police are to release at least parts of it to prove that there wasn't a cover up or some conspiracy.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm sorry you feel like people don't care... i think, if you try and look at it from the perspective of your family and friends, if you're putting on an 'i'm doing great' persona then they may just really believe it to be true. people are generally pretty uncomfortable talking about suicide they may not want to trigger you, they may be afraid of broaching the topic because they just don't know how to helpwhat to say and they don't want to make things worse, or they may genuinely or through their own delusion believe you are ok. the thing is, none of these reasons mean they don't care, so if you need help, ask for it. you can't expect people to read your mind. as you say, your friends and family have a track record for helping when it's obvious your need it. if you ask for help, just be prepared to explain to them how they can support you, the fact they haven't been forthcoming probably means they don't have the tools at their disposal. remember, they're just people too. i hope that makes sense or helps you to see it from their perspective? you never really know what someone else is struggling with, much like they may not understand what you are struggling with... but you can potentially build a strong support network if you reach out openly?</data>

  <data key="d1">yes, if a parent loves his child, he will regularly, unprompted, continually check for problems again, that's unprompted, and if there are any, work diligently until the problem is, not just appears to be, resolved. it's the same for a wife who truly loves her husband and it's the same for a true, lifelong friend. true friends are so rare though and i'm sorry about that fact! people often express how there were so many tears at the funeral for someone who killed themselves, and this proves that so many people cared about them. people will say if i had only known i would have helped and perhaps this could have been prevented. is anybody really going to say oh well. if they had reached out for help i would have just brushed them off anyway even if that is the case? everybody is going to say what they are supposed to say, so everybody ends up saying essentially the same thing. how do we know if 100 of them are genuine or if 100 of them are fake or somewhere in between? i believe i understand what you are talking about. it feels terrible! below is a response to a post titled think of your family comments rant i believe it applies and hopefully some of it interests you. absolutely. people say that committing suicide is such a selfish thing to do, that such people are only thinking about themselves, that they should try thinking about their friends and family and how they would feel to them and how it would hurt them. it's the people who say that who are the selfish ones! they are the ones who haven't thought about how you feel. they need to be asked, have you thought about how that person feels and tried to imagine the pain and torment they must be suffering to feel tempted to do such a horrible thing? if they truly cared about you, they would be focused on actually listening to you so they could attempt to try to understand how they could possibly help you simply for the sake of helping you. the fact that this is one of the first things the pops into their minds is unbelievably selfish. instead of wanting to help, they are focused on telling you to make the sacrifice of continuing to live in constant anguish so that they can continue to feel okay and prance around selfabsorbed and carefree and delude themselves into believing that the world is really mostly okay. almost 100 of people do not think before they speak and almost 100 of people also project their own shortcomings onto others. there are a small number of people in the world that, even though they cannot relate to feeling suicidal whatsoever, are not condescending, so it is possible. for the others however, it is so painful and you think that you can reason with them and explain to them that they weren't really listening, and so you try again under the unfortunate false assumption that if you plea with them and ask them to truly focus and then they assure you that they will, that they will listen to the actual words you are saying, instead of spitting out a preformed phrase or one liner like a robot that they pulled off of the shelf in their brain. speaking to them in such an honest and raw manner scares them they are terrified of reality. deep down, they know there is suffering all around them and so they feel guilty when they are reminded of how callous they are going about each day choosing to pretend that there isn't constant suffering right in front of them. they will deny possessing any awareness of this reality, but they made the very deliberate decision themselves to be supposedly unaware, wearing blindfolds and plugging their ears. it shines a light on how fragile is their contrived image of kindness and compassion. it is convenient to blurt out some trite remarks so that they don't feel guilty as they go on their merry way, pretending as if they've helped. after all, an uncaring, selfish person would have just passed by without bothering to help, but they cannot look like one of those! it would have been better to say nothing at all but they must protect their image above all else, so that all the other people wearing masks of empathy will applaud them and tell them how noble and generous they are to help those who are supposedly weaker and less advanced. it can hurt so deeply because we know that nothing they said was truly intended to help at all all of it was for them. instead of actually having compassion and empathy, the focus is only on appearing to have compassion and empathy. this way, when you point it out, they will say that you are being mean and attacking them, and everyone will agree, adding to your pain. they cannot be made to look bad, so they deflect the attention back onto you, projecting precisely what it is they are doing, on to you. barriers in every place they can think of have been installed to protect their image, but they know how fragile are these barriers so they panic when there is any threat to them. they must protect their image at all costs, and if they perceive that you pose any threat to this, you know they will mutate into anything but kind as you are now their enemy and must be annihilated. you came for help, but you crawl away with another dagger in your soul. when confronted with someone who is in pain and desperately needs help, the guilt of their own selfishness is like a burning coal in their hands and they simply want to get rid of it as quickly as possible, and without thinking or caring how this action will hurt people, they aim it at the most convenient target, at the person right in front of them, the one who is in pain and pleading for help and cannot handle any additional anguish, but they don't care, it is alright with them because they eradicated that uncomfortable feeling. they want you to make the sacrifice of pretending like nothing is wrong so that they can feel zero pain instead of a willingness to feel a bit uncomfortable so that they can ease your suffering just a little instead of adding to your suffering. they are asking you to make immense sacrifices, yet they are not willing to make any. observe people closely. if you observe them projecting their crap onto someone else, that is what they will do to you if you ask for help, and they are 100 responsible for that behavior even though they will try to make you feel like you somehow caused or contributed to it. if you start to feel guilty while speaking to them, it's because they are projecting their guilt onto you. it's devastating to know that they don't really care, but it's better to not share anything than to walk away worse than you came. certain people are so good at appearing to be sweet and so you decide to try again because you are so hopeless and have no help from anybody, but they unfortunately prove the initial observation over and over. it's like they actually get excited when you come crawling by, and they see that you have so many spears and daggers and thorns sticking out of you and you're carrying all of these crappy feelings that refuse to go away and death is like thick tar that is slowly engulfing you. you're carrying so much stuff alresdy that they figure it won't be too noticeable if they just dump all of their crap on to you as well, as long as they appear good while doing so, of course.</data>

  <data key="d1">well. at least you care about your parents. no matter what way you go just know that they'll feel guilt no matter what. that's just how parents are. even if they didn't know it was on purpose, if they care about you as much as you care about them then they are always going to carry some heavy guilt for the loss of their daughter. they'll wonder why? why did this happen? did i do something wrong? she was smart, why did it have to be her? it's going to hurt them a lot for a couple of days. then it'll go away. i guess that's a good thing? i don't know. that's just how my parents reacted anyway. i'm obviously not dead though so instead of feeling guilt, they just feel fear and paranoia. i'm just a permanent scar on them. existing is a burden they have to carry because i failed at the one thing i should have succeeded in. anyway. i have no way of convincing you to stop, no matter how much i'm against it. like you said though, nothing matters anymore. just be careful. it's not 100. in a worst case scenario you could be paralysed and death may not come instantly if you're unlucky. be well, friend.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's understandable why she can't deal properly with it, i believe it's just a lot for her to process. maybe she tried to brush off the guilt by getting back at you, something many of us do when we can't bear the feeling. you didn't do anything wrong, quite the contrary, you reached out to your guardian and to us here in order to get support. i'm glad you did, since it's not the easiest first step there is. the most important thing about failing is forgiving yourself and most importantly seeing it as a guide towards your goal, just like you would do it with success. it gets harder to see through, the more you have of those, but as long as you try to learn from it you can't lose. in reality, we're all just failing a lot, at least i do too. you are enough to get a grip of this, i'm sure. if you feel like talking, i'm here.</data>

  <data key="d1">ive never been so embarrassed. you know in pamphlets how they tell you to reach out and ask for help? i did and she got so mad. i know i shouldnt have told her but she was just going on and on about school and i have depression and am having a hard time in general so it just kinda slipped out... really though, ive never felt so disappointed in myself. or so disgusted i guess, for the first time like ever i feel like there truly is something wrong with me bc of the depression.</data>

  <data key="d1">im sorry youve been hurt this much while showing your vulnerability. there are just so many ways people can react to the truth, especially in negative ones. i hope this doesnt discourage you from trying to reach out to others. but since you are here, im glad you had the guts to tell the truth here, even if its among strangers. dont be disappointed in yourself for suffering from depression. any of us can get it due to the seemingly most unfair circumstances, or even through other sicknesses decreasing our life quality. thats why we should be there for each other, because it was us who had itcouldve had it. depression might cover our good traits and enhance our insecurities, but its not an incurable error we should feel ashamed of. i think its a plain sign we need that we need a support system allowing us to get through this rough patch in our life. youre not alone, were all in this together. if depression ever makes you feel alienated, know that you are welcome here.</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you very much, i cant put in words how glad i am that youre so thankful. its good that you and your mother are trying to fight on the same frontline. we all initially fear the darkness we have to confront the overwhelming feeling that comes with facing it comes with a lot of feelings ranging from disgust to denial. i would say your feelings will always stay precious as they are a product of so many fights from day to day, challenging you to outgrow the wounds they leave on your soul.</data>

  <data key="d1">that's one of the thing that made me want to stay away from professionals. even if they originally got into it because they wanted to help people they're unable to form a genuine emotional bond with a patient which would allow them to truly help someone. the reasons for this are practical and legal so i don't blame them. other reasons is they see too many different people in too short a time so they couldn't form one anyways. so i figure it's always best to get help from friends when possible. i think you did a good thing by reaching out like you have. with all the other people in similar situations its entirely possible to form a support group of your own with them and even help each other out of your respective situations. it's unfortunate that there's been people who actually troll you over it. but for all the chaff out there, there's some wheat too.</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you, depressedfather. its just.... i said some things and clearly wasnt as smart of a person as i thought i was. in fact, looking back i cant believe i thought i was worth dating. i didnt even know how to cook or do things for myself was a teen, 24 now but.... i would have gone to the ends of the earth for this person. and i thought that was enough but clearly it wasnt. they were the first person to ever take a real interest in me, pursue it, and we actually connected. it just hurt when it ended so abruptly. their choice, not mine if it wasnt obvious already. i think because i saw my whole future with this person, and when it didnt happen i just sort of spiraled more in to depression. so the issue for me is that even if i found someone now, im too fucked up now. because there was someone who expressed interest recently, but i pushed them away because i dont know if i can allow myself to be in love again. thus relating to ops sentiments about feeling unable to receive love even if the chance presented itself again.</data>

  <data key="d1">erm.... you do know that humans don't go to heaven, right ? read revelations only 144,000 people out of all the souls in history make it thru the pearly gates. rest of us schlubs gotta make due with paradise as far as freaking people out, well whats the harm in that ? s'good to rock the boat a lil' and make people stop 'n think about things. the more they think about reality, the more they understand certain universal truths, and the wise ones can use that to see the hand of god at work nudging pieces around the great chessboard.... before you go planning your early departure, you might wanna consider that.... and all of the good you have yet to do here on the earth. none of us knows when he will call upon us, to give aid to another or just offer a hand up to get someone to the next stop in their journey. hope you have a wonderful, blessed day !</data>

  <data key="d1">dear bush baby when i read your post i was in awe of your ability to reach out to the world. i am a 62 yrs old male. when i was a freshman in hs i was brutally beaten and raped by two sr's. over the course of an hour. left beaten, bleeding and left alone, they didn't care if i lived or died. i managed to her myself to safety when they left. i went into a downward spiral of barbiturates and amphetamines for the next year. i never had anyone to tell my tale to back then. during the attack and afterwards i was all alone and no one was coming to help me. i finally decided that my life was shit so why not put it to an end. so it was that i sat by the lake and took a big handful of barbiturates. when i awoke in the er, they told me my heart had stopped twice, after that i spent 9 months in the psycward. many years later i am still here. the pain never goes away however one learns to survive. bush baby, if may not feel,like it now, but tomorrow, you may find the one person who makes your life worth living.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah i'm male, 20. i think my parents really don't realise that. i'm not sure what country you're from but in the uk we have this system called benefits, where certain groups of people are entitled to different amounts of money for doing nothing basically based on what category of person they are. me, for example, a single male aged 20 with no disability and not foreign to england, would get about 250 off the government a month to live on if i'm unemployed. although i don't get that because i have fines to pay as my mum had lied to me about paying fines i received for shoplifting the first time i got made.homeless totalling to 400 fine for smashing step dads car totalling to 800. my parents had me when my mum was 17 and my dad was 18. one of the highest benefit packages is for a couple where the woman is a teenage pregnancy. they also receive a lot more support with other things, mainly that the government won't allow them to be homeless. that's where i come into things. she got pregnant with me so that her and my dad didn't have to be homeless. all along i was never wanted, it was a selfish fucking thing she did so that she didn't have to suffer. my whole entire life i always preferred my dad because it felt like he had genuine love for me. growing up my mum always used to talk about me n my brother like we were just income to them. once your kid is born, the government will pay you child benefit which is what she got for me and my brother, plus obviously child support too from my dad. all my life i've been nothing but a source of income to my mum, and before i was even born i was just her key to a fucking house. what i don't understand is she clearly knows what it's like. she clearly knows what i'm going through. but she just does not care about anything i care about or enjoy or want. she's never asked me how my day was. or what i did that day. every conversation i've ever had is you are embarrassing me in public you little shit smack or i did this today at work, and this, and this all she ever spoke about was herself. i genuinely despise that woman. my parents split up when i was very young, that's generally what happens when you have two kids that you don't give a fuck about just to avoid being homeless. i used to visit my dad on weekends, and one time when i was 13 i visited and when i came home my mum had taken every single thing out of my bedroom all my posters, my computer which she gave to my sister even though my dad gave it to me and my sister wasn't even related to him, my bed, everything and started decorating it for my sister. it's so obvious that she loved my sister cuz she was my stepdads kid, and she hated and resented me and my brother cuz we reminded her of our dad or something i guess. but yeah, completely emptied out my bedroom for no fucking reason at all behind my back. so i moved in with my dad, he had been asking me to move in for years anyway and that was the final straw for me so i did it. but once i turned 16 i finished school and didn't really want to go college, i wanted to work full time. but my dad didn't want me to do that, which brings us back to the fucking benefit system. you still receive child benefit for someone i believe up til the age of 18 so long as they are in full time education, but he wouldn't be getting that for me anymore because obviously i was working. so then one day he got me fired from my only fucking job. refused to take me in and that place was two towns over from where we lived. so yeah, got fired for not showing up. then i had an argument with him about it, which is the only argument i've ever had with the guy in my whole life, and that's when i said he had changed since my step mum got pregnant. which is when he made me homeless. and had another child, who he probably only has just for the fucking child benefit. so yeah man, i don't reay know where i was going with all of that, but that's basically the entire story of my parents minus a lot of times when i was little and my mum gave me some fucked up beatings but i'm not gonna whinge about that shit anymore. yeah. but yeah 20 years old now, and i guess i could start over again, but i've done it so many fucking times in the last four years that i just don't have the strength to do it anymore. it's so much man i've started again so many times. i hate it</data>

  <data key="d1">i guess you're right it's just i've made some.bad choices too. i already have a criminal record from the shoplifting and doing stupid things back when i was 16 i got arrested a lot of times. i haven't been arrested at all since that year but it happened. i'm not proud of it, in fact i'm disgusted by the thieving but i somehow always manage to justify it by saying things like i only stole from supermarkets, i never stole from small businesses or people, if i didn't do it i'd have starved and shit like that. got punished pretty severely towards the last few times on that, now i'm on probation too because of it and when my mum called the police on me two years ago for fuckin smashing my step dads car so i am still on it to this day, that shit looms over me like a bad cloud. but a lot of what you just said really does make sense. i do love videogames. before i got evicted from my last place i had my xbox which i saved up for and a new tv it was proper nice big 50 inch one 1080p, never had a tv like that myself before and i played red dead redemption 2 on there, and assassins creed odyssey and that was truly the most fun i've had playing a game since i was a little kid. i remember having the actual thoughts about the characters in the game how i'd become closer with them than real people. and rdr2 made me think about a lot of things too, i'm not going to spoil anything but the epilogue made me think a lot about life. i don't know if i can really explain with words what i'm feeling right now but. thank you a lot for speaking to me... it's unbelievably weird to me that someone i've never met over the internet could give me perspective like that. i expected people to comment something like lol kys or something. i feel like right now i'm surrounded by a lot of negative people and i need to get out of this situation by any means necessary. i've been thinking in that way for a long time i guess i just out death as an option. but just because i need to do it by any means necessary doesn't mean i need to do it by dying</data>

  <data key="d1">depression is no respecter of wealth or opportunity, nor family and friends for that matter. depression just is. there are no qualifying criteria. i have had times in my life where i have had everything...more than i would ever have imagined. there are times in my life when all seems lost and hopeless. throughout both i have not really wanted to live. the one thing i have learned is that if you are truly honest with someone, whether that be a friend or family member, they will often break down and tell you that they are or have been in a similar position. we all put up this facade for the world 'oh, i'm ok, doing good as a matter of fact' even when we are desperate inside. if your friends are true friends, they will not be disgusted by your flaws. if they walk away after you talk to them honestly they were not really friends in the first place. i value quality of friendship over quantity.</data>

  <data key="d1">to someone, who is a bit of a recluse, could you explain the benefit in having friends that you cant be frank with, because you fear they would be disgusted if they knew too much about you, and you still feel lonely and often miserable, despite having them? romantically, single? for a long time? often that changes things, but at the same time, this sub is spammed up with people having relationship problems. a fulfilling relationship could make things better, or also could make things much worse. i have given a lot of thought to what you are writing. tried posting various times and ended up deleting. what you are experiencing seems very abstract, i am also left wondering if this could all be more rooted in something you experienced in the past.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know it's a bit late, but let me answer. i could probably be frank with my friends every logical part of me says so. however, i also have this deeply rooted fear of commitment, which leads to me not really being frank with any of my friends. but in my eyes shallow friendships are better than no friendships. i've tried both, and i know which of the two i find better you're right that a fulfilling relationship could make it both better or worse, but a fear of commitment and a fear of disappointing will probably keep me away from trying i don't know if it's rooted in the past. truly some shit has happened my parents' divorce, death etc., so it wouldn't be unreasonable. i find calling it abstract pretty accurate, considering that, despite me having experienced this for 5 years or so, i still don't really know what causes it, and i can in no way predict when something happens with my mental state.</data>

  <data key="d1">are you? i've been battling depression anxiety and self harm for 20 years. i don't get to choose what to feel. if i could cherish my life i would. i'm glad that you rebounded from your symptoms but it's not easy for some people, and it's impossible for others. meds are required for me, wisdom from loved ones don't quite balance out all my brain chemicals.</data>

  <data key="d1">definitely go, it's worth trying to escape the mental prison before its too late. i can't say that this'll work for you but try to incrementally work in positive routines in your life. for example try improving personal hygiene and diet then cleaning your room and start doing some exercise, something that's not too intense but still enjoyable. if that's a 30 minute jog or 10 minute walk doesn't matter. if you just want to talk i'm here for you bro, and if we happen to play some of the same games then perhaps we could play together?</data>

  <data key="d1">i genuinely feel so bad for you as someone who suffers from low confidence myself, i can't imagine your internal pain. i thought of a way you could hypothetically improve your situation and i hope it helps 1. apply to every job you can find possibly work multiple jobs if you need to 2. save up money for your teeth and to buy healthier foodsif you do want to change your weight 3. look at different dental options to find an option that works for you. in the meantime, you can look at teeth whitener, and for the pain maybe some over the counter drugs. you seem like a very smart person and you probably already know what you have to do as you said, the real world doesn't work perfectly for you, but i just wanted to lay out some options even if you've already thought of them. i hope you can get your teeth fixed and lose weightonly if you want to, while also coming to terms with yourself. i'm positive you can do this, it just may take some time and work. best of luck</data>

  <data key="d1">i appreciate the feedback, thank you. otc drugs help but only a little. it never lasts. as for whitening, that's a bad option for me. it'll only make my teeth more sensitive, and it'll clash with the fillings i have in my front teeth, which are made to be the off yellow my teeth are. it's just so much money. first the xrays and then individual reshaping as well as fillings. i don't have thousands of dollars and i probably never will to just spend. bills can fuck off, teeth can fuck off, i can hopefully soon fuck off. i'm so angry and exhausted with life. that being said, i appreciate you trying to be help and being kind. you're a good person.</data>

  <data key="d1">i am really sorry to hear that you're hurting on all of those levels. the pain is more than enough to rob you of all your energy without having to be confronted again and again by how you look. the situation regarding the costs for dental work is also really tough. i don't know if it helps much but regarding your current situation, make sure to be gentle with your teeth and not to overdo the brushingflossingswishing. ways to notice that are bleeding or overall searing pain when you brush or floss. are you using gentle strokes? i am asking because i have had difficulty with this myself in the past and what has helped me finally was using an electric toothbrush where i couldn't add more force thereby continuing to destroy my gums... and with regard to clenching, see if you can try a plastic mouthguard you wear at night. using one has made my jaw muscles relax a lot there are some inexpensive recommendations here sorry if that doesn't help much but i really want to help you. the first step should be to manage your discomfort by making sure that you are being gentle with your teeth and gums. after that, consider continuing pain medication so you can have some more distractionfree moments. those first two steps will take a lot of effort how do you feel about tackling those first? the third step is much more long actually working on your smile.... you mention that you experience incredible pain which means the clinic you go to should actually give you a bit more attention. pain can be the precursor to many more serious conditions. managing whatever you might have is a top priority make sure to not leave or at least keep returning until someone takes you seriously. don't be rude or angry per se but serious and show that it is indeed urgent. i know that you might be feeling incredibly down and have lost all confidence because of your smile but realize that you speaking out about this is a really huge step. sometimes we are so ashamed that we can't even bear to tell others. you were strong enough to speak up and it shows your character. it might continue to be embarrassing and painful in the future but know that there are things that you can do and that no one else has the right to judge you.</data>

  <data key="d1">that is a helluva list. i'm really sorry to hear about your troubles. i'd say you don't deserve all that but there's no such thing as deserve in the world. nothing is fair, so no one deserves anything, good or bad. you said that people hate you. that's fine. no really it's ok. the only thing that really matters is that you know in your heart that you're a good person. you need to know that no matter what anyone says about you, you haven't done anything wrong. you have not done anything that warrants being hated. so if anyone does hate you, it's their problem, not yours. just try to let it go. you said you hate yourself because you're gay, but we both know there's no logic to that. you have not done anything wrong. just relax it's ok. people come and go in life. like a lot. you're gonna meet roughly 900 million new people in your life and i'm sure after you get through the immaturity of school, the people you meet are gonna be a lot more understanding. just keep going and you'll run into better fortune, for sure. by the way, i don't hate you. i know i don't know you, but still. i am actually sorry that you've been having such a tough time, and i do care, sincerely. big fat internet hug sending your way, if you want it.</data>

  <data key="d1">many people who took their own lives did not want to truly die, but sometimes life and certain circumstances makes you feel like you have no other choice. i remember 3 years ago i did not want to die, but i did not see the point in living just like you and right now i feel like i do not care about anything and the only choice i got is suicide. it is probably the consequences of depression. many people lose the battle against it, especially when they have anxiety and other mental illness. they all go together and is extremely hard to fight against. after some time, it can weaken you to the point that you will want to give up. as i noticed, things rarely get better with time, unless you are lucky and find someone who truly loves and cares about you.</data>

  <data key="d1">maybe you keep returning to this point because those feelingsideas are so ingrained in who you are. even when you're feeling better, there is still that subconscious part of you that causes you to have these thoughts. also i think that having no faith in humanity is an important factor, because in the end everyone is affected by choices and actions of other people. nobody likes indirectly being controlled by people or things they do not trust. assuming these things, it isn't 'something you're doing' as you wrote. i would argue it's part of who you are right now, which isn't changed that easily. but that is just speculation, i have no formal training in psychology at all. x200b either way i wish you all the best and i hope that someday you will be able to just enjoy your happiness when you're experiencing it without it being overshadowed by such thoughts.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have a family and i feel the same way as you do. i dont want to hurt them or anyone else. however, just yesterday i was grilling some chicken and my grill immediately caught on fire for whatever reason. i immediately went into survival mode and threw a big bucket of water on the grill, putting the fire out. i did think to myself before putting the fire out if i would not have acted and just let the fires continue to blaze until it ignited the propane tank. would i die? would i be so injured, that i couldnt go on anymore. it really got me thinking about if i should just end it all. ive been wrestling with this thought process since the beginning of 2019. i hope you dont hurt yourself.</data>

  <data key="d1">i lost a friend today. we were actually more than friends but also had to figure some things out. our relationship was complicated but we actually just needed time. she was the hardest person i had ever met and it was showing. we kindda slowly broke down. the final hit was a few hours ago. but to sum it up, she couldn't give me what i wanted. and apparently i couldn't give her what she wanted. i knew this would happen and i've had really hard times. now i just feel empty. you can't imagine how much i hate it. i don't know if any of this can help you but, as i said, i knew our thing would end because we simply didn't fit. both wanting diffrent things. who knows, maybe it was for the better. things do have to fall apart for other, maybe better, things to born.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have to disagree. i met someone almost two years ago and at 27 years old i can confidently say hes the only person who had truly had a positive and lasting effect on who i am as a person. theyre rare but they do exist. and one thing ive learned from knowing him is, you cant rely on others because theyll mostly let you down. the nature of my friendship with him often leads to me being hurt or disappointed in him which is unfair and i fear will cause us to part ways prematurely. best thing you can do is look out for yourself and let people feel how they feel. the thoughts and feelings of others is exactly that and has no real weight on you even when it feels that way.</data>

  <data key="d1">a lot of people put themselves first, i've found it's better to just fight your battles alone... although i can't say i'd ever willingly leave someone else in that position if they wanted help... it really just depends in the person i guess. you have to suffer yourself before you can understand someone elses pain, but even then sometimes... you don't want to try. a lot of people think their own pain is enough and for many, it is... some people can just carry more than others, and those are the people who might help you.</data>

  <data key="d1">experience has taught me that my issues and experiences have given me valuable perspective, perspective that most folks don't even need to know exists in the world.. are happier not knowing and remaining oblivious. to them, i'm fine. masking the issue from these people while the issue is ongoing abovebelow their heads has become a pleasure, something i'd feel proud of.. which helps the meds.. the pointy end of that stick, due to everything being on record medically, if you ever need to smack some perspective into one of these people.. lift the curtain a bit, stare them in the face and tell them to stop complaining to you about whatever it was they were complaining about. i've found ways of dealing with the way things are, rather than trying to change them. it allows me to build more than just these bricks could build on their own.. and being capable of adapting like that will keep you employed for as long as needed, employment paying the bills and filling the time, keeping brain occupied from things i can't change. do you think i'm a mental, or smart? x200b smentart. just found a new word. x200b i'll not change, not reboot.. i'll build new using the bits we have</data>

  <data key="d1">i know the feeling, but i know that i care about others sometimes to a fault. the problem is that depression doesnt go away even when someone does truly care about you and try to help. its frustrating for everyone, and rule 1 is you must take care of yourself before you can help others. mental illness exacerbates everything. just remember, there are really good people out there with big hearts. they may not be able to cure you, but just having them around makes things better even a little bit.</data>

  <data key="d1">that's exactly how i feel and it is actually completely true. especially if you mention that you have any type of mental illness, mainly bipolar disorder, paranoia, schizophrenia, or depression. people will automatically think that you're going to hurt yourself or others. people have tried to 'help me' in their own ways with my mental health issues whenever i was in a bad place, but that didn't help really. ultimately, i had to find a way to help myself and find activities and stuff that would make me actually enjoy life. i now know who i can and cannot trust and have been cutting the toxic people out of my life and though i still struggle with my demons, i still feel alot better. though i don't know the situation that you're in right now, just saying that i feel this way alot. edit though there are some amazing people in this world that do care. it's kind of hard to cherry pick because on the one hand there are people who do care, but there are others who don't. again, i don't know your situation really so i have no room to give you real advice, but to just give you my situation, how i feel, and that you aren't alone in feeling this way.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have been thinking the same way as you for a very long time. after several way of thinking in that selfdestructive, negative manner, i've decided to change. change starts with you. yes, there are a majority of assholes in the world. egoistic, lazy, selfcentered people. but there is and will always be a portion of people who are not like this. you just need to find them. and the only way to find them is by becoming one of them. open your shell, widen your horizon and switch up your perspective. i can sadly not tell you what exactly was my 'trigger' to change myself, but it happened. i am just a regular human being. sometimes i am a bit strange or weird, but that is okay, i accepted that. a few years ago i was only milliseconds away from death. i can say i've looked in the eye of death, if there was not that guy who rescued me last second. nowadays i am the happiest, most positive i've ever neen. if you had told me how i will be in the future a few years ago, i would have laughed at you. to this day, there are numerous scars all over my legs, reminding me of those dark times. if i could go back in time, i would tape my fingers together so i can't do those horrible things to myself. even though i regret those decisions so much, i will not let them bother me too much. my view is growing each day and each day i learn new ways of coping with the world and new ways of seeing our world. change starts with you. positivity starts with you. instead of being part of the problem and complaining about it, be the spark of change. if i made it out of this dark hole, you can too. i believe in you, and i don't just say that, i mean that.</data>

  <data key="d1">you're dealing with something that nobody should suffer from and i'm so sorry. depression is so hard and sometimes it's amazing how little we know about the brain and how to treat it. i'm just curious to hear more about your story of fighting depression. 1. have there been periods weeks, months, years in your life where things were better? 2. has your psychiatrist helped you try different medicines and dosages to see if you respond better to them? 3. do you feel like you have tools in your toolbox which are helpful for managing depressive thought patterns and breaking out of them? 4. do you have friendsfamily that provide you with support?</data>

  <data key="d1">no, depression is not a hard time, it's a hard, painful life. have you heard about people who're struggling because of depression for all of their life? from 8 years to 33? i did a lot. and the final option they discovered is suicide. so if you're here to promote your cheap words about life worth living, i want to ensure you that you've never been in situation when there's no hope for cure. just no hope. x200b it's like a cancer. it can't be cured. you can just die in pain, or die because of euthanasiasuicide.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey there friend, as someone who has suffered from depression and anxiety for about 4 years, possibly manic i empathise wholeheartedly with your struggles, having felt the same way when i made attempts on my life. im getting help now but it feels like im going nowhere too. the only thing right now keeping me alive is the people i would leave, because i dont want them to feel sad. most people on wont help you in terms of committing suicide, but please talk to me if you want help with not committing suicide</data>

  <data key="d1">oh then i dont know. all i would recommend then is finding someone you really hate and focus on outliving those bastards, because fuck them. but its hard as fuck and everything is pain until suddenly it isnt anymore. if it is because you die or meet someone new or get a pet or it suddenly goes away i have no idea, but the pain does go away one day. unless hell is real, then im gonna burn forever</data>

  <data key="d1">i don't like hating people, and i never advice using hating as a fuelmotivation. i love people even though they're bastards sometimes, yeah, i love the beauty of the world. and i cry every time my depressive attack ends, because it was so painful that i just forgot about how life can be beautiful. but today it has changed. my depressive attack, which i have been wrapped in for 4 last days, ended, but i realize that i just can't bear it anymore. even despite i don't feel such a pain right now, i know this will last for just few hours. then, again, pain and nothing else except tremendous pain.</data>

  <data key="d1">you're absolutely right. i should focus on the positives and i really try, but i just have so much hatred for myself and im trying to focus on using that hatred for something better than just hating myself, so i'm using it to motivate myself to stay alive. it is really hard to stay through it all, its painful and just exhausting. do you know anything that prolongs the ok parts? or if you can make the bad parts less bad? like distracting yourself or watching netflix? dont know if it helps hut i hope it do. and i hope you tell your psyciatrist that you dont feel that the meds helps, everyone is different, maybe the meds isnt for you</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah, i don't believe you're in the same spot as me, it just can't be so bad. at least, i hope so. i really wish you'll enjoy the life and not focusing on hating, but on loving that's not helping against my depressive episodes, but helping enjoy the good parts of it way better. if the attitude is your problem you can solve your problems by introducing more love and kindness to your life. yeah, it really works! but my problem is chemistry. fucking broken neurotransmitters in my broken brains that just make me feel nearly agonizing pain for just no reason. are you struggling because of obesety? it's not difficult to keep a diet and lose weight. are you struggling because of money? you can start bussiness from scratch, just having a computer and learn coding in google, that's exactly what i did in the past! all of the common problems are easy to overcome if you have healthy brains. that's the key. just create a plan to follow and your problems are solved in 1 3 years. if you cannot follow your plan that's unhealthy, broken brain. if it fucks you up for no reason and making you cry and praying for quick death, that's impossible to resolve. my dream is to cut my head, take my brains and smash it, because it has ruined all my life. that's the only thing i hate in this world. my broken brains. and i hope you tell your psyciatrist that you dont feel that the meds helps, everyone is different, maybe the meds isnt for you look, dude. i've tried 5 different psychiatrists, 10 12 different meds schemes, about 30 40 different medications and you see me looking for a way to overcome panic before hanging myself. that's a bad hope that leads to even worse depression.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, i see what going on here, i dont doubt that you have faced extreme and perhaps emotional abuse. people dont give you the care and respect that you ought to have from everyone in your circle. you are not alone and im deeply sad to hear this. i know a little bit about what its like to feel surrounded by people who dont care and who feel like hurting or pushing you away. you are a fine person, i can hear it in your words, youre honest and real and youre thoughts are coherent. i think youre really facing something here and i feel you need to find a place away from whatever place youre in now. is that possible for you to go somewhere? to really take on this shit youre going through and make it known that you want better for yourself? can you step away from the shit, bring your gaming computer, whatever it takes and just spend some time somewhere else. maybe you can sell it off and get a laptop, something portable. i think youre gonna need to distance yourself from the shit situation your in for long enough before you can think of a way to better it for yourself and find a path to a better future. but it sounds like you need a break now, not just a lonely escape into the computer, but a change of environment. video games are great, they can make you feel happy and bright, but you need a different place to be.</data>

  <data key="d1">breakups hurt, but it doesn't mean you're unlovable, some people just aren't right for each other. unrequited love is painful to go through but it's something nearly everyone experinces at least once in their life. grieve the lost of the relationship but don't forget everyone or everything else in your life. if you get through this you'll have a chance of meeting someone else.right now it feels like she's the only one for you, but that isn't the case, we can be happy with many different people and lot of people feel this way at the end of the relationship, before their able to meet someone else.</data>

  <data key="d1">it can be really tough going through a breakup, especially when you cant't move out into the world and live on your own and have to continue living with your ex. i think that the relationship was toxic while it may have been good at times, it's not worth the mental state of two people deteriorating. no relationship is. it know it must be very upsetting finding out that he doesn't commit to a relationship even though you two had already gotten engaged. now to address the part that he was questioning his sexuality. i know all the change is hard, but you have to respect that. understanding one's own sexual identity can be so hard for a lot of people, while for others it comes easier. so when somebody is struggling with their sexuality, it's best for them to get support from even the most unexpected places. it sucks to imagine somebody close to you abandoning everything you've shared and starting over with a new person. but let me tell you, it is not a punishment. the two of you just weren't perfect for each other, and it honestly sucks. i hope you feel a bit better soon. you'll eventually find someone right for you just be patient, even if it feels like an eternity has passed.</data>

  <data key="d1">breaks up hurt, and its normal to feel shaken up after the loss of a relationship. the hardest part is always the immediate aftermath then you slowly start to adjust. grieve the loss of the relationship but don't tell yourself it has to be your last or that you can't meet anyone again. lot's of people go through breaks up when their young and it hurts, but its pretty much never the final relationship. don't stop doing things because of them and focus on other parts of your life to.</data>

  <data key="d1">the title is the reference. not really related to the topic at hand. granted, i suppose it's an 11 year old reference. i'm not about to go into detail about my life. not much point since everyone has their own set of issues in life. but it just seems like life doesn't like me saving money this past decade. only a matter of time before something else happens that costs me all the money i have, and it will likely be something medical related, i'm sure. our bodies are just gold mines for institutions to make money off of. but really, my resentment is towards life itself, not something trivial as the greed of others.</data>

  <data key="d1">you have to see a future for yourself. where did you picture your life being by now when you were younger? what have you felt a passion for in the past? your job sucks and your friends suck. it means you need to create something that doesnt, because your value as a human being is far far beyond what you do for work or how a handful of people treat you.</data>

  <data key="d1">thats ok, its rare that a kid has an actionable plan for the future and even more rare that it pans out. first, if you genuinely dont know what youre doing wrong, then thats your answer nothing. second, failing out of college does not mean you failed at the thing you pursued. have you seen the infinite spectrum of things people buy nowadays? you can selfpublish an ebook on amazon, or drop off a few pieces of art at a local event or gallery with zero expectations. and if you enjoy either, you owe it to yourself especially because your job sucks. think of your job as a tool, a secondary support, that can allow you to do other things you actually want to do. at some point or another, youll come across better job opportunities but in the meantime, dont let it suck you dry. the same goes for friendships. i know its tougher to make friends the older we get, but if you can dip your toes into other avenues, things you like, that would also open the door for you to expand your social circle. i know its all easier said than done, but dont diminish your abilities with writing and drawing. of all things in the world, these are so subjective that you cant really go wrong. run with it, who knows where it would lead. and if youd like a second set of eyes on your work before you unleash it into the wild, id love to help.</data>

  <data key="d1">losing someone you love is really hard.... very painful. harder than physical pain in a lot of ways. i don't know if this means anything to you, but it helped when someone said it to me. the reason breakups are so painful is that, the longer we're with someone, the more we start to build a future with them in our heads. when we break up, it's not just that we lose the person, but that future selfrelationship we imagined also dies its the loss of that fantasy that hurts more than anything. as hard as it is, what this person told me was that you really need to remember that all that future stuff was just a fantasy.... you're mourning what might have been, not what would have been. you really don't know what the future holds, and it's not fair to assume the one you had in your head was actually the best one you can have for yourself. anyway....i get how tough things are for you, and there's really no easy way to heal except for time. i hope you can give yourself that.</data>

  <data key="d1">maybe it is best to accept you did a bad thing, you acknowledge you've done a bad thing and you're a better person now. she's probably trying not to think about what happened, and all you can do is try to focus on being a better person and living a better life, maybe help others avoid the things you did or try to make things a little better with your own life. speaking from experience, i did something to someone i cared about and have had to live with the guilt, it sucks but it's not insurmountable</data>

  <data key="d1">thanks for the reply. but did you experience, and if so how did you get past, feeling you didn't deserve happiness? sometimes i think that the least harmful thing for me to do right now is just live the best way i can and try to be a positive force in the world. but any time i start feeling happy i feel guilty because i don't deserve it. and then i become miserable which i think is the right thing to feel and that starts the spiral again because i don't think i can maintain this and my suicide would cause my family pain so i have to stay alive... and the loop just starts up again.</data>

  <data key="d1">i had an ex do something like this, but tell everyone she was pregnant and i was abandoning her. of course it was a lie i lost all of my friends but the 1 that believed me and a good part of my family. i used it as an opportunity to cut all of them out of my life. they never cared for me if they were so quick to go aganist me. it was pretty satisfying when someone tricked her into telling the truth and everyone tried backpedaling into my good graces. i'd suggest using this as an opportunity to try the same op, see who actually supports you and cares about you. those are the only people you need. i hope you're lucky enough for the truth to come out, good luck and keep your head up i'm cheering for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">i couldn't agree with you more. after being detained in a psych ward i felt worse, not better. after going to therapy for a while and even switching to a new one i'm realizing that's bullshit too. antidepressants are just another drug pushed my pharmaceutical companies as a treatment, but i don't understand how relying on a pill to function makes you better. everyone i knew on antidepressants are on them indefinitely. people think it's easy to stop dealing with being sad or suicidal because they don't experience it themselves. they don't understand how to react so get help is all they can say. 5 people have called the police on me so far on different occasions because they're trying to help or make me get help but they don't realize how stupid that is</data>

  <data key="d1">this post speaks to me more than any other post on this sub for probably ever. you sound like a chronic depressed person like me. medications messed up my already messed up sexual functions, and male hormones. doctors never tell you this, or they try to downplay the side effects of medications, but i was young and naive and took all those prescribed medications for a year, and they messed me up. i am still trying to recover from them after stopping for over a year now. i think our mainstream mental health treatment is still at a very primitive stage compared to a lot of other health departments. hospitalizations are just temporary holding cells to stabilize suicidal crazy people until we are subdued and zombified with meds. therapy are just a loose support structure that never really helped me. i even had some decent therapists, but at the end of the day it's just 45 mins a week like you said. maybe treatment helps some people, but definitely not some chronic sufferers like us. your bad experiences on long term treatment places is interesting to me. i was never able to go to those places because economics don't allow me to, but i always had this fantasy that those places are where rich people can get the real help, i guess maybe not so easy. x200b hopefully your pain will ease with time. hopefully you'll find some real solution along the way. i can't wait to die.</data>

  <data key="d1">i started on a more spiritual path, in terms of life philosophy and our purpose here. once i had settled on optimistic nihilism none of this matters...yayyy i then focused on treating my physical self, training my brain to reprogram itself by rewarding my own good behaviour and when i ignored stimulus that would normally make me spiral. i then went onto cbt and some one to one therapy, which after telling my therapist about my childhood she said something that has been said to me repeatedly 'you've done really well considering' and for once that actually stuck. after that it has been a case of redefining how i look at myself and other people...this has caused me to lose friends...the ones who realised they could no longer bully me. i wouldn't say there is anythiny i will suggest to you as my journey is my own and i truly believe that people need to do this for themselves and by themselves. also because no one thing was the thing that helped it has been a accumulation of my life experiences and my want to sort myself out and love me for me.</data>

  <data key="d1">ok let's just take a moment to hesitate here. life isn't always easy, things don't always get handed to us on a platter. sometimes we get pig shit shoved onto our plate and forcefed down our throats. that's not fun. but that pig shit won't kill you, all it can do to you is taste so bad that it makes you want to die. think of bad times in life as the pig shit, and good times as actual meals that you enjoy. yeah, sometimes you have to eat shit, and that sucks, but that doesn't mean that an actual meal will never come. don't give up, just endure and resist as hard as you can. people can, and probably will help you. you just have to make a step to say hey look, help me i'm eating pig shit and this isn't fun. that was a really weird metaphor. but you have the will to say no more to whatever you're going through and seek help for it. stay safe.</data>

  <data key="d1">your posts dont typically read in your favor, even though you try hard to push a pity narrative. good on you for recognizing your narcissism but you have to make the concious steps to not be narcissistic. i.e texting my fiance how ugly and awful i am so he leaves you dont want him to leave, not going about it that way.</data>

  <data key="d1">the pills will take their effect, and you will regret taking them due to the excruciating pain they will ensue and you will possibly die in the process. it's not worth it, not this early. give it a couple of years. thirteen years is too short a period of time on this earth to judge it fully. you may fall in love in the future, acquire hobbies, have your favourite video gamesbook series continue, etc. try to make it to 18, then do whatever you want. i'm not saying things will get better. that is a trite, useless platitude, spoken from a position of strange assumed omniscience. i'm just saying, it's too early to think they won't, dude.</data>

  <data key="d1">why would your friends cut you off for report your rape? did they think you were faking it? though it sounds like they wern't really your friends if they'd do that. it's normal to be hurting after a relationship ends, and it's normal to be hurting after losing friends of pets, anyone would be in pain in your shoes. give yourself time to work through it, the hardest part is always at the start. as for losing your friend to suicide i hope you find this reddit useful</data>

  <data key="d1">just don't let anyone run your life. i get it, easier said then done but in all honesty, occupy your mind and just let nature takes its course. you are your own temple noone else is the top monk of your temple except you. take a deep as fuck breath and just ask yourself, really have a conversation with yourself why would i want to do that to myself? just ask why and let all the answers flow. if its because you love her then why would you want to off yourself? don't you want to see where this life will take you? give yourself 1 month of recovery. by then she'll realise your good and watch her run for you. when that bridge comes.. well that'll be your choice if you want her back. give yourself time, dont waste your time on her ok? take care of number 1 and that be you.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm going through something almost identical to this. if she's willing to talk to you then you need to make it clear to her that being towed on a line is detrimental to your emotional stability and mental health. if she really cares for you then she'll settle on how to behave because causing someone you love such strife isn't healthy for either of you. if she's there for you then you two need to work out communication to help heal from this and create some stability. if she's not then you need to take the initiative she's not taking and walk away from it regardless of how painful it is. like says, don't let someone else ruin your life. take that time to reflect and figure out what it is you need, what it is she provides, and if you two are really compatible. that last bit is a hard pill to swallow, and honestly when it comes to my own situation i'm sure i'm in some serious denial about it...maybe you are too. once you figure somethings out on your own, and when she comes to you next don't go to her this time around tell her you two need to have a real talk about what's going on and how it's affecting you. in the mean time, keep yourself in check. it's hard to stay afloat out here but there's plenty of anons on to act as a buoy when you need it. i hope you got some friendsfamily you can open up to about this too, if not then keep up the chat here. best of luck and take care of yourself.</data>

  <data key="d1">let me break this down for you my friend. a few years after i started dating another girl, a girl who just acted like she wanted a romeo to run away with. she didn't have the best fam but she seemed like such a real down to earth kind of human being just looking for a better start. really she was a con artist just looking for another couch or house to crawl to so she didn't have to go home to here. she happened to meet me right around the time my grandma's health was unsaveable and she departed shortly after. it broke me, i was the only family around and i lost myself. i was not the most pleasant to be around that time of my life and shit went spiraling downhill after. she ended up always leaving and coming back, telling me she loved me one minute and then she would come home and suddenly not even by the next night would tell me she just couldn't be with me and leave. it broke me, i was already broken from the loss of my grandma and stress of trying to figure out what to do with everything including the two dogs she left behind to me still here, one passed but beside me none the less but she would just play the back and forth game over and over. she even left me one night, sent me a pic of her half naked on snapchat a few hours later and said she missed me again or some shit but then five or six hours later literally she moved 20 hours away to be with one of my friends off xbox. then few months later she called crying to come back, i sent her 500 dollars to greyhound home and she did. i picked her up one night in the middle of the night. it was magical when we seen eachother again and it was all tears and happiness. i tried to leave in the past who or what she had just done and be thankful she was here. i took her out all weekend to see old friends and family and i remember i went and bought her some ariel the little mermaid vans or some shit. and i'll be damned if not even a week or two later she was gone again. every moment in this story where she played whatever bad hand, it broke me and every morning i woke up the first thing on my mind was dying and it would continue on the whole day until i finally could sleep and it was the last thing i thought about. i spent so much emotion trying to prove i loved her that i forgot completely to love myself. i didn't matter to me and i didn't care what happened to me so what about that would be so appealing and make someone want to love you or continue on being with you? you gotta love yourself. there's so much more to that story and like i said i was no saint at the time and was as lost mentally from everything as could be but instead of attempting to be there or care they just used it for power. you move on, i've honestly dealt with a worse heartbreak than that. ten times. it just wasn't a shitty messy ordeal and unfortunately i still think about that person. even pretty heavily some days but you just have to continue on. not everyone you love you're suppose to hold till life ends, just how life works but it doesn't mean you can't be happy and it doesn't mean you can't be the most amazing man or woman for somebody worth it and somebody who needs your love like you could really use the touch of theirs. but always my friends, love yourself first. be good to yourself and be kind to yourself. as you find out, sometimes or maybe even most times all you have is yourself to relay on and care for you. so care for them. be there for you and be a better person everyday, the rest comes in time i promise you. much love and fuck that shit. keep your head up for you i promise you i've been there. don't sit down there, climb.</data>

  <data key="d1">ive been in the same boat. ive had a few girlfriends but i cant seem to get over them every time. even though i find new girls the thoughts never entirely go away. sometimes i get panic and depression attacks that make me want to cut myself and kill myself. the best thing you can do for now is try to distract yourself. find something fun. something you enjoy if you can. how long have you guys been separated?</data>

  <data key="d1">hey friend. i've been where you are. i know you don't want to hear it, but you have to cut all ties with her. keeping her in your entourage is like keeping the knife in the wound. maybe ripping it out will hurt like hell, but at least after that you'll be able to heal. and i know it doesn't feel like it, but i promise, after some time you'll begin to feel a little bit better. it'll take time, i won't lie, but it will happen. please give yourself a chance.</data>

  <data key="d1">leaving a relationship often feels like drug withdrawal imo. but this whole relationship dynamic was probably unhealthy, if you kill yourself now you wont experience a relationship again. and they do get better over time as you get older if you learn from your mistakes. so take your time and mourn this and in time itll get easier.</data>

  <data key="d1">if you see no point in having a relationship, dont have one. not everyone needs or wants a relationship. in the time i've spent alone all of my time tbh i've found it much more rewarding to let go of the people you fancy and focus on yourself. if you dont want a relationship with someone else focus on creating a stronger relationship with yourself. if you do really want a relationship with someone else, still focus on yourself. if you are happy and content alone, then you are in a place where you can work on creating a life with someone else thats built on the foundation that you are enough.</data>

  <data key="d1">no. your purpose on life is to reproduce and to be in a romantic relationship. you choose that your life isn't worth living without being in a romantic relationship. objectively, there are millions of happy single andor childless people on earth. that's just a fact. i don't know what ''void'' you are talking about, but obviously your relationship with your friends and family must not be very deep or great for you to think that. i'm sorry about that and i hope one day it changes and that you attribute more value to your life than just dating and procreating. good luck.</data>

  <data key="d1">have you considered cutting contact and letting yourself be sad? the longer you spend fighting the feelings the more power theyll get. block her number, email and every social media contact. if she reaches out with concerns tell her that you need space and time with your own family and friends. if she persists, block block block. itll take a long time but you will feel like yourself again soon. it takes energy and effort, though. try to not let yourself obsess and wallow. cry when you need to but also make sure you go to work when you can, see a movie and see your friends more often. then cry and be sad. then pick yourself back up and push on. each pickup will get easier and eventually not hurt nearly as much. a friend told me it takes half the amount of time of the relationship to begin to properly get over that. he gave himself 2 years to feel bad, eat whatever and be where he needed to be. after that he quit smoking. he then started a healthy eating plan that he stuck to. now hes started exercising. those three things took at least 23 months each and im glad he took it slow. hes now a lot healthier and happier and recently had dinner with his ex without feeling awful. he was able to look at her like a person again and not the person he loved. it was really freeing. try not to force anything and just let yourself be for awhile. youll get there.</data>

  <data key="d1">been there done that. hated it. i hung on words of an ex for a while. went through the i hate myseld to i hate them to i hate everyone. then for some strange reason i snapped out of it. maybe it was because i found someone new that made me blush. don't really know. just know youre worth more than empty words from a selfcentered ex. from what it sounds like, she really dont give a damn and is only stringing you along in case her current relationship doesn't pan out and she got you to fall back on until she finds someone new. you're worth more than that as well. i'm not going to say get over her because that's literally easier said than done. its not a stomachache. feelings linger for a while. concentrate on you. your mental health is worth a whole lot more than the ego of someone else.</data>

  <data key="d1">same thing happened to me man. as she was packing up the last of her stuff and getting into the car we hugged and said we loved each other. later that night i called her in tears saying this was a huge mistake and that we should still be together regardless of where our lives are taking us. she said she'd call me back in 15 minutes because she was busy at that moment. i haven't heard a thing from her in over a year and a half. that shit really fucks someone up. i've worked through it with therapy and time, and i've seen how what we had was not healthy, nor was it good for me to idealize the good times in that relationship. you just have to keep moving forward. learn to live with yourself for who you are now. then once you remember who you are you can try forming new relationships again. i promise you those new relationships will be far better than anything you had before, because you'll have the wisdom and depth to be in them for the right reasons.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah, when you're depressed people telling you to just do it or decide to be happy is so aggravating. i was more hinting at a trained therapist. it can be really helpful to have someone to vent to without judgement or bias. if you're seriously feeling terrible you may want to try something to help alleviate that feeling. weed seriously saved my life. i hadn't smoked in over 6 years, and i was in the pit of depression ready to check out. i just tried it and it really helped me see my life from a slightly different perspective and broke me out of that depressed thinking cycle. i find cbd to be the most helpful now without the paranoid high effects. if i'm sinking again taking 5htp can really help boost me to feeling normal. idk, just trying to help man. i've been through this and in many ways am still in it.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah therapy is expensive af. i just got a new one recently and it's been super helpful. it sounds weird but she does hypnotherapy and it's really helped a surprising amount. it is 200 an hour but i got amazing insurance at my current job so it's covered. if you've never tried 5htp i'd highly suggest it. it's not the kind of thing you want to have to take regularly, but just taking it occasionally to clear the fog and feel happy and motivated can really break up the monotony of depression.</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel you. some people, men and women, are essentially just users. unable to grow their own lives independently, they latch on to others like a parasite. if they are skilled at lovebombing and your normal state is unhealedunhappy, it can be the best drug in the world. but the love bombing is false. they dont love you, but they love the statussexcomfort etc you are able to bring. i got so crazy i bought mine a car after his got repossessed. i am not rich. i strongly recommend resources to help you heal from codependency, and learn what healthy relationships look like. you do need to love yourself. if you currently hate yourself, try generating a feeling of love for your microbiome, the universe of life forms that live in your body. i found it a helpful bridge to self love. melanie tonia evans has some amazing free resources on youtube for healing codependency. im getting happier every day, and i wish you all the best edit most importantly go no contact! she cant play hot and cold if she cant talk with you. block her on social media, block her number, and focus on building and healing your own life. no need to be dragging an anchor around.</data>

  <data key="d1">bro, you are giving too much of your energy to someone who does not deserve your energy. i know it's hard since i've been several times in that situation. but the truth is if you want to be in a healthy relation you have to learn to love yourself. my ex left me in the worst time of my life, it was hard, it was dissapointing, her attitude was exactly like yours. my thoughts now, bitch i'm glad you left, thank you. thank you for showing me your true colors, thank you for let me know you are not a person i can trust so i don't have to waste my time on you anymore, thank you for leaving me alone, i proved that i can be by myself and still be happy. my advice is block her from all social media, delete her phone, and avoid all contact with her. if she calls you tell her you are no interested in talking with her and hung up. it souns rough and unpolite but the priority should be your mental stability and belive bro, you wond fint it if you keep in contact with her. avoid her as the plague is my advice. appreciate yourself and your time, please pput this in your mind and stick to it i don't have time for mixsignal women.</data>

  <data key="d1">i was in the same boat as you for about a year with a girl who was also manipulative. it took me a long time to recover. i would see any girl like her in public with another guy and think it was her and freak out. i was always thinking about her, hating myself, wondering what i could do, all that. there's a lot to it, but one of the things that really helped for me is realizing just how fluid life is for lack of a better term. you guys had your time together, good and bad, and that's it. it didn't last forever and it doesn't have to. things going to shit now doesn't mean you have to hate and forget about whatever you had before. it took a lot of time and pain but eventually i learned to come to terms with it and accept things for how they are. if you want to stick around in this life you'll be doing a lot of that as you get older, but it gets easier and easier. and i know it doesn't help to tell you this now but i will anyway, someday you'll look back and be amazed at how incredibly small your world was to be pining over one girl! nowadays, 13 years later i am so much better at accepting and realizing when someone isn't right for me and moving on with no hard feelings. it's just part of life. also as for the obsessive thoughts, in my case it was also fueled by mental disorders if you're interested in potentially talking to a psychologist. total shot in the dark here but in case you're into philosophy, this helped me a lot personally so might as well put it here for you. amor fati lit. love of fate is a latin phrase that may be translated as love of fate or love of one's fate. it is used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one's life, including suffering and loss, as good or, at the very least, necessary. moreover, amor fati is characterized by an acceptance of the events or situations that occur in one's life</data>

  <data key="d1">people who are your friends or close to you, wouldn't mind if you talked about your problems. i had a friend who said she was there for me. i actually had a crush on her. but when i talked about my problems, she always didn't care. she would give me half assed answers like just sleep earlier yes, like that'll make all my problems go away. she would constantly poke at my depression saying it wasn't real. saying that i shouldn't have it because i didn't go through much. i know you have a deeper connection to this person you are talking about, but just look at all the negatives of it. look into the futute. if she pushes your problems away, what will she do that is worse in the future? does she actually care? is this all part of some manipulative scheme? take some time and think about yourself. you deserve to be happy too. you need real friends or so who will lisent to you. now, said friends might not be there all the time to help. that's okay. but if someone says they will help and the moment you start talking they leave you, that's not someone you want to be around. it'll take time to get over the person you love. especially if you truly love them. but you have to know when something is getting toxic. don't make the same mistake my ex made</data>

  <data key="d1">i broke up with the love of my life 8 years ago, and it took me seriously years and years for me to get over her.. it's insane actually when i think back how long it took for me i have to add that i was fucking 18 when we broke up.. when i thought about her with other guys, i wanted to end my life because it was so hard to think about. well, i thought up till quite recently that i may still have feelings for her. i met her in my hometown when i was there and i felt absolutely nothing for her. i actually wondered why the fuck i glorified our relationship that much. my point is that it will pass. it hurts like hell now, and i can absolutely relate, but just know that it will 100 pass, just hang in there bro.</data>

  <data key="d1">what's meant for never misses you, and what misses you was never meant for you. make moves do things you want to do with people who care about you, don't waste yourself concerned with people who couldnt care less about you. why should someone who doesn't care about you have so much power over you? ask yourself that. love yourself and do what you have to do for you. also whatever future hopefuls you have of her dead them. nothing you do now will be for a possible future with her. if she were to show up in your bedroom, your first thought should be about the police or to tell her to get out. you guys don't get another chance because that'll screw with your other chances of happiness. good luck.</data>

  <data key="d1">with maturity and communication there isnt heartache, only mutual understanding. most of your pain comes from not understanding why shes doing what shes doing, as well as an innate feeling that shes right for you and doesnt realize or respect it. i cant tell you how many hours i spent trying to understand my ex. but if you could really take a step back and look into her mind youd raise your eyebrows and back away. you really wont get it until you find someone who is actually right for you, theres none of this crap. theres no distrust, no fear, you click and thats it and when its time to move on you understand why and accept change just like everything else in life. another aspect is separating your idea of her from what she actually is, thats another skill learned only through painful falls back to reality. welcome back!</data>

  <data key="d1">and you'll find someone who will care for you even more than you can imagine. i can legit guarantee you that. there's sooooooo many people out there, honestly i'd be optimistic if i were you. you now have an opportunity to actually find someone who's going to give a shit about how you feel, and put you before themself. block her number, social media, everything. nobody that actually loved you would do things like that to you, knowing how it makes you feel. my wife knows me better than anyone in the world, and she does everything in her power to keep me happy which can be difficult. it sounds like you're a fucking great guy to be honest, and you actually give a shit. time to find someone who is similar.</data>

  <data key="d1">i understand exactly what you mean. im 17 and over the past year ive been through about 3 girlfriends. every time i keep thinking that ive finally found the one after crying my eyes out, hurting myself, and wishing i could die every night. i would cry myself to sleep often. the first love is always one of the hardest. things go so right and feel absolutely incredible. its something youve never felt before. its a great feeling that you cant even seem to describe. letting go and moving on from them is one of the most difficult things ever. as teenagers as well we have extremely strong emotions. were getting our first introduction to what love and relationships are like. some ways to get over her is to write down her flaws as to why you guys wouldnt work out together. you can also try and understand why she broke up with you, although that one really fricken sucks it can sometimes help. remember, as well, in break ups its not one persons fault. relationships are there own being. both are at fault for all things that happen. also just let it all out, cry and just let the emotions flow out. find a therapist even. thats what i did and still do relationships at no matter what age will always be learning experiences. the wonderful feelings of being in love to the crushing feeling of your life feeling like theres no more meaning. the pain that you wont get them back. one of the worst things is that im sure she has little quirks about her that nobody else you see will have. the truth is though, that all people in the world have those little details that you can get attracted to and fall in love with. you begin to become even more attached with every cute little quirk. that will happen with every girl you meet andor date. if youre also attached to the physical side of things, like her body and looks, know that everyone has different aspects of them. every individual is different and unique. when you find the next one youll probably end up feeling the same way with those tiny and cute details.</data>

  <data key="d1">honestly one thing i will say is that the thing about your young years being your best years isn't always true. i know it is for some people but i think my most miserable years were during university. i had a way better time later on. so don't think that you're currently at the peak of your existence, you're not.</data>

  <data key="d1">people who say being a young adult are your best years probably just forget how tough it was to be young. adolescents have it incredibly hard in our society they are treated like children, but are expected to act like adults. they have no money and there isn't much sympathy from older generations...because they tend to think you are 'healthy' and free so what's there to complain about. it isn't easy being 18 and there isn't much direction from society to help guide you. i struggled at age 18 and so did most of my friends did, so there is no shame to feeling like you're in the gutter and you shouldn't feel like you're faulty just because there is an expectation that you ought to be happy at this point. we say that people become adults at 18, but the frontal cortex only stop developing at around age 25. that is the part of the brain involved in selfcontrol, doing the right thing over the easy thing, emotional regulation, gratification postponement and emotional regulation. you are still developing so don't assume how you feel now will carry on indefinitely. i'm sorry for your loss. most people go most their lives without losing what you have so ignore the people who say you should just be happy at this point. there are some great communities in the void we call the internet for bereavement, sexuality, etc. you are not alone and if you want to talk further then the void is here for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">when i was 18 i fought depression as well. but now ive gotten better because i chose to fight it. i changed my life and myself to become what i want i hated the man i was. im sorry but the only one who can drag you out of it is you. others in your life can give you support, but the hard truth is that no one will lift you up from depression. once i realized that it was so much easier to start. hope this helps</data>

  <data key="d1">when i was 16, i desperately waited till 18 because i thought it'd be better. when i was 19, i waited desperately for 21. truth is, nothing changed. but things are better now because i have a stable job, decent career and i feel like things are actually better not great. just better than it was simply because of the control i can have and do have over my life. one thing i realized though, is that what really changed is that i took control of my life. if i didn't like something, i figured a way to change it. if i couldn't change it, i learned to process and accept it. i know my advise sounds clich as fuck but it works for me. i still have depression and anxiety but i find it easier to manage because i have a lot of self awareness and i push myself to do something about my situation, even if it's as simple as taking a shower or washing my bowl.</data>

  <data key="d1">so i want to help you partially from a relationships perspective, i'm guessing the bf was a little irked you don't like your job because like everyone nobody likes their shit ass jobs, and of course it escalated from there. it wasn't just the job though there is likely more to it than that, perhaps he felt he wasn't making you happy and your depression reflected back on him, who knows what's important it's that time will heal these wounds and you'll get better and maybe it is true he didn't make you happy. the key is we can't let our happiness, oh so how powerful it is, hinge on the happiness of others or their love for us, we have to love ourselves through our faults and weaknesses so i want you to listen carefully, you already accept a sort of finality to our shared end, i want you to accept that there's also a shared joy for us out there. you live in wi, i bet you a can find a clear night sky, you came from there, we are all going to wind up there, let's have fun with it while we can</data>

  <data key="d1">stop calling yourself ugly, that's not what we're talking about. i don't think you understand and that may be my fault for not explaining. it's the parents job to make sure their offspring is safe at all times no matter the cost. if your parents want to bring strangers into their home when they are single then that is fine but your parents have children so that means they have to be 200x more safe and secure because its their job to make sure you are safe. when your parents allowed this stranger into their home they failed as parents and allowed a potentially dangerous person to have access to their family. i know that you talked to her online but that is not how we should evaluate people depending on the content of their online personality.</data>

  <data key="d1">what makes you think theres anything waiting on the other side except a bigger hole to crawl out of? if there is peace after death i don't think you can cheat your way to that outcome, thats not how anything else in life works aside from superficial successes and gains. i don't think you get to deny lifes beauties with its horrible imperfections without subjecting yourself to the will of something bigger than you or me. i walked, ran, climbed and tripped my way out of a state of suicidal ideation and overcoming each mental obstacle and barrier placed on myself with help from my insecurities became my driving focus. get out of town, hike through some creeks, eat something you've never tried. step off your path, overcome some irrational fear and good and bad choices for fulffillment will be there to pick from.</data>

  <data key="d1">wow, you went and spoke to a mental health team and did nothing for you. thats awful. can you call them and say its serious and you need help now. you might as well give them another try and if that doesnt work, theyve really failed you. maybe you had calmed down when you saw them and so they didnt take you seriously. i know youre mad and angry right now over not being able to get help. but could you just have yell and cry and get it out of your system that way rather than trying to kill yourself first. what sent you over the edge that you just cant handle things on your own anymore?</data>

  <data key="d1">i believe you. so much effort put in. the drive to get help finally. and then to be sent home with no plan. the mental health team let you down. i feel how tired you are. take a break if you can to think about something different. maybe watch a movie. thats what they should have helped you with. and to have people concerned about you. so sorry that they are making you work so hard. hope is very important. im so mad that they didnt give you any. maybe tomorrow theyll have something for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">im so sorry for your heartbreak. it is painful, jarring, and soulcrushing, but i hope it is not worth ending a life that has not been fully lived yet. you are only 31, and as much as it doesnt seem like it right now, there may come a point in the future, perhaps when youve grown emotionally, perhaps when youve met someone else, perhaps when youve done things you never thought youd do, that you will look back at this moment and be proud you did not go through with it.</data>

  <data key="d1">make whatever decision is best for you. however i would like to bring something up you might not have thought about. would it not make more sense to make the decision when your in a neutral state rather than after a terrible life event like heartbreak. i was cheated on and wanted to end my life straight away. but i knew it was irrational, it was the emotional damage from being cheated on. so i decided until the pain numbed to make my decision. i still want to but not really because of that situation anymore. also the pain i experienced after a break up was like no other so i can empathise with you. i was in a truly terrible state for several months and was sleeping 1517 hours a day to try and numb the pain and not eating for days. it was easily type of worst pain ive ever experienced. looking back i wish i had tried some sort of treatment sooner. i wasnt on any mediation, i didnt have the energy to try anything. i analysed every aspects of the relationship when i should of been seeking recovery. i broke up with her but it still hurt just as bad. i couldnt forgive cheating for a second time.</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you so much for being so honest with me! the issue is that she broke up with me in april, and recently she made it very clear that she's not interested in starting over. so my decision is not fuelled by the break up, but by the hopelessness. i am not willing to live 50 years more without her. knowing what happiness is like and then losing it is much worse than not knowing it in the first place.</data>

  <data key="d1">im 30 and i felt the same when my last relationship broke down. he cheated on me when i was pregnant so i got an abortion and it made me very ill and i haven't recovered physically. emotionally thoigh i'm with a man who is amazing and i sometimes laugh about the fact that i tried to kill myself over a previous partner that means nothing but past pain to me now. replace her. if she cheated on you then she's a very replaceable person. you're just still in the moment. it took me over a year to lose the love but it does go.</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you for sharing your story with me, i'm very happy to hear that you're on the right track! no, she didn't cheat on me, as it turned out, she got afraid of moving to another country where i'm living because i behaved in a rather childish way sometimes got angry, couldn't think with a cool head. but i'm fine now in the sense that i'm not feeling absolutely anything now, there is a huge void of space in my head.</data>

  <data key="d1">feeling despair and hopelessness can definitely lead to suicidal thoughts. you must be in extreme pain. are you scared to talk to your loved ones? have you been hurt before that makes reaching out to people really difficult. if you can reach out, youll feel so much better. you had the courage to reach out here and i hear and understand youre in a lot of pain that you are holding in. loosing a relationship is a huge stressor and can make you feel like no one will ever love you again. it would make you feel lost. can you write a letter asking your loved ones for help if you are too scared to ask in person? you need someone that is caring right now. just a bit of care can give you hope again. youre worth it. and none of this is your fault. youve been trying your hardest to feel better. its just so hard to do by yourself. you need help whether from your family, loved ones, or a therapist.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's normal to be reeling after a close relationship ends,. take some time to grieve the loss of it but don't tell yourself you can't be happy with anyone else, even if it feels true it isn't true, lots of people break up with someone they are sure is the one and eventually go onto meet someone else who returns thier feelings, though that doesn't mean what you're going through now doesn't hurt.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm sorry you are going through this. if there are people you would like to reconnect with then i don't think you should stop yourself. can you just say something like i'm sorry i haven't been around, i've been feeling down for a while and ended up isolating myself. having pushed people away doesn't make you a shitty person. it is a symptom of depression to isolate oneself, and it just makes the depression worse. i try not to presume what people's reactions will be anymore, i put it out there and let them make the decision if they want to reconnectforgivewhatever. the vast majority of the time i've been relieved by their response. don't be hard on yourself, you are already suffering enough. what you are experiencing isn't unusual, and is a normal response to the stresses you are under. be kind to yourself all the colleges i know have therapists available for students, that might be something to check out. what are you in school for?</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm deeply sorry you're feeling like this. have you tried to seek therapy to help you cope with some issues? you usually say the fault is yours that your friends don't talk with you but it's not clear what you did for them to react that way. whatever it is, i think you should benefit from therapy.</data>

  <data key="d1">i don't think you are worthless. i don't know you well enough to make that determination, but what little i know of you from what you've said here tells me that you care about your wife and daughter, and that is enough for me to give you the benefit of the doubt. if people don't want to hire you, it is surely because they are afraid. nobody wants to take a risk. you could be the best worker they ever have, but they'll never know if they don't give you a try. everyone wants to limit liability and choose the employee that looks better on paper. i'm sorry that this is hard for you. no matter what you may now believe regarding your worth, in terms of what you can provide for yourself and for your wife and daughter, remember that they love you. to them your worth is probably not something that can be measured with money. they certainly want you to be a part of their lives, or your wife would not have sent that email. it may take time to get what you want. the steps on the path to that place may involve doing things that are very much not what you want. simpler jobs that pay lower wages, or that pay cash, i have found involve no background checks. they just care that you can show up and do the work. labor jobs, like short order cook or janitor. i know it's not glorious, but it's work. and the more of that you have in your work history, the more stable you will look to employers in the future. stay connected and involved and form new relationships. one day you may accidentally meet someone who is impressed with your work ethic, discovers that you have some advanced skills they didn't know about because you didn't advertise them, and then will give you an opportunity that you never expected. it has happened to me. and stay connected with your wife and daughter. they probably want to hear for you, no matter what you have to say. just be honest and remember that they love you.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have recently discovered the value of helping others. i've chosen to help people that need my help, mainly because i can, because i am unemployed and have the time. it doesn't mean that i can avoid working on my own stuff completely, but it does take my mind off my own stuff and makes me feel useful. i haven't been volunteering, but i have been helping friends with some stuff. one friend moved out of her exfianc's house after living with him for 10 years, and i spent several long days helping her pack. she gave me some tasks to do that let her focus her efforts on other things because she knew i was handling something else important, and it made her more productive, even though she had several fits of crying in the midst of it. for my part, i got a pretty good workout and slept better than i have in months, and even woke in the morning to see the sun, which is a big thing for me. so the feedback from this experience and others has been so positive that i think i may pursue more formal volunteer work, like the humane society or such. it doesn't merely keep me busy it helps give my life meaning, and gives me immediate feedback that i'm doing something to help make the world better. and it's a great way to meet people. you never know who you'll meet and what totally unexpected opportunities it will provide.</data>

  <data key="d1">youre in such pain right now. its getting so tough to hang in there and its hard to hang in there for yourself. youre doing it for your mother and for your kids. how many do you have? taking care of kids while depressed takes a lot of energy. youre really tired and so sad. youve probably been fighting a long time. have you been wanting to end your life for awhile?</data>

  <data key="d1">your children will never forget you. if you decided to end your left that decision would affect them for the rest of their lives. it would shape who they become. they might even end up following in your footsteps. they need you here. as a parent, you have a purpose that extends beyond yourself. you owe it to your children to keep trying. you can get to the root of this sadness that you feel and find ways to cope and even overcome it. its not easy, but it is possible. you brought those little beings into this world. you mean everything to them. they need you to guide them through it. you have a very important role in their lives, whether you realize it or not. you matter and whatever youre dealing with, just remember that life isnt static, it is always changing. edit i read some of your other posts. the way you feel right now is directly related to your situation. you and your children have to get out of there as soon as possible. your husband is severely abusing you and also corrupting your 4 year old by encouraging him to do the same. hes a sick man. none of what is happening is your fault. please get in touch with a domestic violence help line in your area. or the national domestic violence hotline 1 8007997233. they can help guide you on how to leave safely. you are in serious danger and so are your kids. nothing can solve domestic violence in a relationship or marriage. men like that are not capable of love or being good partners. it is never your fault, no matter what he says.</data>

  <data key="d1">you're quite welcome. my words aren't necessarily rational either but that worldview keeps me kicking and screaming instead of giving up. just some dumb suggestions but maybe take the fascination with death and point it somewhere productive. write a poem or song or essay musing about death. watch a horror movie. play a horror game. etc. might help you figure things out. years ago i read a great horror novel called twilight i know right about a psychotic anethologist who'd kidnap victims, kill them, then bring them back to life with his drugs and interview them to find out what they saw on the other side. it won't answer your questions exactly but it's a super interesting premise. found it</data>

  <data key="d1">right. that's the point. how someone else thinks of my death matters not to me. they're opinion and life has no bearing on my choice or anyone else's if they choose not to care. living can be seen as a middle finger, i can't say i disagree, but death isn't not a middle finger. disclaimer, i'm not actively suicidal, but this is how i felt when i was and feel now, even though i'm not dying means life no longer has a chance of fucking me over again. i no longer have to put up with it or anyone else in it. death prevents terminal illnesses and a slew of emotional, mental, and physical pain that is associated with living. i'd be free of all desires and wants or thinking i need certain things i don't actually need, but still cause me distress because i don't have them.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey man, ive been a music teacher for 15yrs and struggle with depression often as well. i make no money and have no upward mobility at all. recently a girl i was beginning to fall in love with left me in part because of my career limitations. ive been searching for the last six years for any way to get a feeling of a deeper contribution to the world through music without much luck. and most musicians i find to be very insular and egotistical powered by their insecurities id gather so im often almost always alone. its hard enough as an artist, feeing like you're in a world that doesnt understand you and clearly wasnt built for you, without even the support of those who think and see the world as you do. like those on this forum, musicians and artists need each other just as much, and i wish the collective would grow up and see this fact. point is, you made me see another potential use for my gifts. maybe i can do music therapy or host an open mic at least. i think you should pursue music. many like myself are depressed because of how deeply we feel the world around us. this feeling needs an outlet or it gets turned inward on us. i think youd be a great musician. its just a bit of a mechanical learning curve but if you can find something about the act of playing that feels good then youll discover that theres always a place of surrender, an ocean of release there. good luck, friend.</data>

  <data key="d1">agreed, it's a meaningless and almost insulting thing. it's also one of those things you can slip out of through a loophole. sure, maybe some aspects end up getting better... doesn't mean it's what you want or worth living for. i also hate the notion that at least you tried and other things of that sort make it worthwhile... if i'm going to be here, i want to actually enjoy it, not live to piss off the universe or beat some invisible enemy you can't actually beat. this society, this world sucks and isn't getting better. i am tired of screaming pointlessly into the void. the void looks back. you can't outstare it, but how can you ignore it once you know it's there? it infects you. and life is work, and distractions, and disappointments, and exhaustion...</data>

  <data key="d1">people say things like that because it actually got better for them. that also means that there is a big damn catch on it. i suck at drawing ah just keep at it, it gets better! what people miss in that statement is that it won't be better if you just wait around for years for it to become better. no one have gotten better at drawing by sleeping for 10 years. it only gets better if you actively try to make it better. and yeah, sometimes you draw something hella ugly by mistake. actually, that's what you will do most of the time. sometimes you don't even see that it is until someone points it out to you. yeah thank you for making me feel terrible, bob! but here is the catch, if you continue to draw you are going to draw the most horrendous things over and over again, but sometimes it just clicks. like discovering the lie about primary colors and suddenly all colors are good again just for a moment. but then it lies in plain sight you still suck at anatomy. every single body you draw from then on sucks just a little bit more than it did before. it's so much more clear to see now when the colors are mediocre instead of bad. and there is one more catch it have gotten better, but other things are still horrible. don't let anyone take progress away from you, even if it seems worse right now. when it gets worse, it might be even better afterwards. but only if you don't wait for it to just happen by it self. and yeah, that is exhausting for someone that starts at the bottom especially when it's not about silly drawing skills but about something essential like living. people are not lying most of the time when they are saying it, but they have a hard time remembering that they have a completely different perspective</data>

  <data key="d1">death is inevitable anyway so you might as well wait for it to come naturally, you'll find out where your ego goes whether you take your own life or let it come naturally, the diference being that if you wait it out and live your life you will have experienced more and know more when death comes, and that might be worth something.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm just a random stranger on the internet, i don't know your exact situation nor your relationships with your family. so i can't give a precise answer. keep that in mind. anyway, i don't think there is a way to make it less painful, and you have to live or die knowing this, if your mother truly love you, that would destroy her. that's the harsh reality of things. i have a loving family and i plan my suicide soon, and i know it will destroy them, and i hate myself for still wanting to die, but honestly, i'm not responsible of their feelings, of course i don't want them to be sad, but that's how it is, i don't have much choice. i think the best you can do is writing a note, trying your best to explain why you did it, that she isn't a failure, telling her are awesome of a mother she was and asking her to not be sad about it, but i don't think it will really work. i would like a way to not make my family sad too, but i don't think that's really possible.</data>

  <data key="d1">i wasn't planning to be a mom, let alone a single mom. i hate every minute of my life. it consists of work, cleaning, washing bottles, feeding the baby, washing diapers and 4 hours of sleep a day if i'm lucky. and then it repeats samebdamnbthjng every day. i live with my mother, who watches my son at night while i go to work. every time i talk to her she is only able to respond with uh huh. i just hate it. i called her today bc my son was just crying and would stop so she came home from work. and now i'm drinking and chain smoking and feel even worse for doing it.</data>

  <data key="d1">i dont have great social skills since i was bullied and had extreme social anxiety. did not have any friends, and at this point i think im almost used to being alone, although there are periods where loneliness hits me hard. i dont know where you live but if there are free or available mental health services, you can start therapy or see a psychiatrist. maybe they can do this together and take baby steps. ill honestly say at least being able to talk to someone without feeling like ill be judged for being awkward puts the pressure off me to act calm and good at socializing</data>

  <data key="d1">i almost died on seroquel, xanax, and beer. it was horrible. i woke up in the icu tied to the bed. i had to be airlifted to the nearest trauma hospital. i was hallucinating severely when i woke up. i wasn't actually trying to kill myself but i didn't care if i died. let's put it that way. the nurses treated me like shit since i was there due to my own actions. i realized then that apparently i was meant to live. even though life sucks worse than ever right now, i have no choice but to face it and deal. i am still a trainwreck but i'm alive.</data>

  <data key="d1">im so sorry for your bad experience, i hope youre doing better than you were back then. i had a doctor be an asshole to me too but my nurses were nice. i have a severe phobia of throwing up and they made me drink the activated charcoal which didnt even really make me sick, much to their shock i was crying because i was terrified and that bastard was so rude about it, he said, in the most assholey voice possible then you shouldntve taken pills then threatened me with shoving a tube down my throat and pouring it through there. he was a jerk the rest of the time too but i dont remember much else</data>

  <data key="d1">i ended up taking a lot of pills, they told me if i hadnt ended up in the hospital i wouldve died. the pills i took fucked with my heart a lot, i had a prolonged qt interval which makes your heart beat really fast and wrong and can make you go into cardiac arrest so thats what wouldve killed me</data>

  <data key="d1">like i tell everyone else, i'm sorry about how you've been feeling. and when i say sorry, i mean it because seeing people think they're worthless about themselves is very hard and saddening because i can relate to that. i know one post may not be able to change anything or cause anything significant. at times i can feel exactly the same way you do. i don't know you personally. i don't know what you've been through. and i don't know what you're going through. but i wish if i could, i wish that i could instantly make all of your problems go away. if it helps, think about it like this what makes you useless? is there some formal paper saying your name is the most useless person in society and doesn't deserve to live at all. of course not. i've learned from cbt that just because we may think or feel a certain way, it doesn't make those emotions true. i think we're all struggling with some sort of personal problems, mental health issue. and it worries me and saddens me to see people being hurt. but at the end of the day they're really just thoughts, like if you think about it we let thoughts control our lives. which too me i kind of find funny, whenever i think something negative, i just remind myself it's your brain, not you.</data>

  <data key="d1">well thats just hateful. i guess all the old people who have retired or drawing disability should die then right. i mean they no longer contribute to society. does that mean if something ever happens to him and he cant work that he needs to die? basically herniating a disk in your back while tying your shoes and being bed ridden for months waiting on a back surgery is worth capital punishment. anyone can get hurt or have health issues at anytime and cant work, ext. anymore. those people would have to die just like the people who never attempt to do anything. dude dont let him get to you. his opinion isnt relevant, you may find a way to contribute someday, you never know what the future could hold for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">nothings that black and white. youre loved by someone, even if its your family. what would be useless would be you not being around for the ones who care about you. its true, the world would be a better place without people who just sit around and do nothing literally nothing. so do something, anything, even if its having a job at a gas station, making just enough to rent a room. contributing to society doesnt mean having a university degree and making close to 100 grand a year. but thats just one facet of life think about the other joys, like your family and friends, your personal tastes in things, traveling, relationships of any kind, the little things that make you smile. those things have nothing to do with contributing to society. dont take it as contributing to society, thats too grand of a picture for anyone. take it as contributing to your wellbeing. and remember pizza and dr pepper exists! stick around, you only have one ticket to ride this crazy spaceship called earth. might as well see whats in store. theres more to life than youll ever know, and you wont even know till the credits are rolling. and who knows maybe theyll be bloopers, or a marvel like ending. and one pro tip a little cathartic screaming in the woods does wonders.</data>

  <data key="d1">even though youre completely right, at least you told someone. at least you tried. the most i worked up to with my friends was making jokes or sharing shitty suicide memes, and once they started asking why i found them funny i immediately remembered why i dont talk to anyone about it. still though, its admirable to me.</data>

  <data key="d1">the best way to reduce withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines such as clonzepam is with a slow tapering off. this should be controlled by your doctor to avoid life threatening consequences. depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts can also be a result of withdrawal. i'd advise going back to your doctor and slowing the tapering process if the withdrawal symptoms are causing significant concern for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">she herself cut me cold turkey, but gave me 20 0.5mg tablets to take at night in case i have more insomnia. she simply told me clonazepam is good for making you sleep, but your body... uh.... can get used to it. then when i started having the symptoms i called her and she simply told me if you're feeling uncomfortable, you can take the 0.5mg tablets at night. that's what i've been doing and i'm on day 4 of being on 0.5mg. i took 1mg at nights during one month and then 2mg during 27 or 28 more days, so almost two months. is going from 2mg to 0.5mg ok?</data>

  <data key="d1">as i'm not your doctor, i can't give you a direct answer on this as it's unique to your situation and medical history. going from 23mgday down to 0.51mgday isn't uncommon, and you have to bear in mind that continued use of benzo's will result in your body building a tolerance to them and them not being as effective. i would continue taking the evening doses for the time being to help reduce possible withdrawal symptoms, and make sure you get plenty of fluids and healthy food to help you through this time. if your sleep is an issue, there's medication that can be prescribed for that using benzos for such a purpose is... uncommon. certainly in the long term due to the addiction and tolerance issues. some antipsychotics, like quetiapine, can be used off label for sleep and doesn't have the same kind of addiction issues but your body can become dependent on being knocked out instead of naturally falling asleep. additionally some antihistamines, such as promethazine, can also be helpful as they're usually quite sedating and in promethazine's case has some antianxietyagitation properties but again don't have the addiction issues. it kinda comes down to why you can't sleep.</data>

  <data key="d1">i wasn't diagnosed but after 10 years of trying it just means i will not likely ever have kids, not the worst thing. if you really want kids you could always adopt. being a breeder is not as great as people make it out to be. it is a preconceived notion passed on by society that i think is ridiculous. it makes people like us seem inferior but eff that man! i let no one tell me i am less of a man because i can't have kids! that is bs. there are some 7 or 8 billion people in this world already there is no reason to add to that pool. i hope this helps man because this is just how i learned to cope with those folks that say hey, got any kids? i proudly say nope! not gona either. yeah it still has underlying pain but i try not to let that hurt me because it is someone else's rules, i make my own rules. i have a dog and a wife, there is nothing more i need. i used to let it get to me, not gona lie. my mother used to bother me about the whole 'when am i gona have a grandchild' all the time. she has finally resigned herself to calling my dog her granddogs. family and cultural desires can really be a bother at times. you could also throw it back in their face to make them feel bad as well. just say to them 'my balls don't work, but thanks for asking' or something next time they ask you when you're having kids. i don't know if this helps at all but if it gives you courage to keep living that's great.</data>

  <data key="d1">im so sorry that you feel so awful right now. you wonder if your feelings and thoughts are true. go with your gut and initial feelings. your feelings are valid and no one can take them away from you. just because he has a different version doesnt make yours invalid. there are usually different views but it doesnt mean yours is invalid. you said no, and he didnt respect that. you were sexually assaulted. you didnt consent to that. you said very clearly to stop. no means no. he just wants to believe you said yes. thats so he wont feel guilt and shame for what he did. i hope you get help from rape crisis groups in your area. you need lots of care, reassurance, and guidance right now. you dont need to doubt yourself. but i understand if you do. it was horrible what happened to you and its not right that he is trying to dismiss your pain. your feelings are valid. youre scared and having suicidal thoughts right now. you want the pain to go away. that makes perfect sense. a way to help diminish the pain is to talk to an understanding person that will listen to you. get help from rape crisis groups and think about getting a therapist to help you process everything and start to heal. it sounds like there is more to your pain, too, and its all hitting you at once. its overwhelming. its hard to deal with all on your own. im thinking of you and i believe you.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's normal to feel somewhat lost when you're young. its definetly possible to change, 20s is all about deciding who you want to be and what matters to you and how you can get there. people don't suddenly figure out how to adult when they hit 18, there's a lot of stumbling and self examination involved. don't think you have to 180 all at once, just focus on a little bit at a time. don't give up on yourself, you're still young and lots of people you're age don't know what they want from life</data>

  <data key="d1">intrusive thoughts are pretty common, and they can be violent the way yours are. i have intrusive thoughts of stabbing myself all the time, for example. it's only a problem if you find the thoughts highly disturbing or if you feel like you're going to act on them i.e., you're going to harm yourself or others. in either case, therapy can help you deal with the thoughts and medication may reduce their frequencyintensity.</data>

  <data key="d1">your life is what you make of it. you say you have nothing good to contribute but your very presence helps those around you to end it all is permanent and has long term effects on those around you if you feel like you've accomplished everything then why not do something different? travel, get a different job, skydiving? or simply join a new group? there are so many wonderful experiences that can enrich your life but also i believe for you it would be beneficial to speak with professionals if it ever gets too much. i'm here if you need to talk and i hope i've helped even if only a little!</data>

  <data key="d1">my pleasure. its difficult to start positive habits and break negative habits but routines after 35 days tend to stick. it was also hard convincing myself i was worth celebrating but then i realized i battle a version of me everyday who doesnt care about work, doesnt love anyone, or help in the least way to make the world a better place. every day i win against that other me and that should be celebrated.</data>

  <data key="d1">honestly those two friends are worth more than a billion dollars. if youre happy with them and enjoy your time, than its worth it. its what i look forward to myself since i only have a handful. at the end of the day it really is the small things that matter. those moments of just playing games and shooting the shit and forgetting lifes big worries are so great.</data>

  <data key="d1">you are lost and without purpose they told me we choose our own purpose in life because life is meaningless. i laughed at them first, but now i know they were right. i found my purpose, i found it today. because if we are going to live with regrets all of our lives, we might as well choose a purpose that you know you are going to regret tommorow. because it doesn't matter, it never has. don't be scared now. after all they will never know what is it to be like us.</data>

  <data key="d1">it can be very hard to find what makes you happy. i often would worry about helping others be happy. 1 i liked doing it and seeing people find that joy. 2 i could find it in others, but not in myself. x200b i gave up trying to find things that made me happy thinking i was different. i am still on that path of discovery and it is hard. although, what helps me get through is knowing that i may not have that thing that i do that makes me happy but that doesn't mean i can't have happy moments doing things. there are things that generally speaking don't make me happy to do, however there are some of those times when doing those things i am happy. it's a slightly different approach one with potential.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm sorry, man. this sucks. the roots of addiction lie within not without. look inward. at the shame. i once knew a guy who was addicted to heroin and later meth, like you, in addition to frequently experimenting with lsd and other psychadelics. he found himself wandering around the new mexico desert a ways out of town one day, with no money, no food, and deteriorating health. he had sacrificed his entire life for drugs. there was no way out he had wasted every opportunity. there was nobody to run to he had burned every bridge. i met this guy much later. as an engineering professor at a large state university, in charge of multimilliondollar research grants, directing other professors, and respected by all of his students as a great teacher. not on drugs. if you stick on the recovery train long enough i promise things will get better.</data>

  <data key="d1">is it possible to get into some kind of program that includes living in a grouphome situation? hopefully, there will be rules to help guide you toward a more productive lifestyle. your family doesnt deserve coming across your bloody or vomitcovered body. a coworker of mine walked into a scene where her husband had blown his brains out in the family room. she died months later at work! of a heart attack. dont do that to your family. see if you can get into one of those programs, though. with something to work toward, and a bit more discipline, you can achieve some real progress and make something of your life.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've been there man i've overdosed 3 times man and like recently is the first time in like 10 years that i'm glad i'm still here today, i understand how you feel and you're not wrong to feel that way because this world is fucking awful, but and i get you've heard this a million times as youve said shit will get better and be around for that, this social anxiety you have and these thoughts you get are the hardest to live with i won't lie but look for help reside in a family member or a friend look for help because it's hard doing it by your self. dont leave this life this life is hard but once good things come its beautiful in promise, you have worth to this world and you're young your luck can change at any moment school is awful once you leave it removes a lot of toxic energy out of your life when it's done. i mean i don't know if this has helped at all but my messages are always here</data>

  <data key="d1">for me, taking things into my own hands helped a lot. so getting treatment for gad was the first step. once the head was clear enough to think better, began working on health, cleaned my lifestyle up. then to career, so forth. like anything else its baby steps all the way. but i cant stress enough how much taking steps to improve your health will improve your outlook. dedicating time and effort and physical exhaustion will awaken primal survival instincts that go dormant with an unhealthy lifestyle. it will teach you that youre capable of better and that the work you put into it, however small or incremental at first, is worth it and can pay dividends. good luck and dont give up.</data>

  <data key="d1">as someone who has been both heavy and really slim, i totally get where you are coming from. i was a much happier person when i wasn't obsessing about my weight and what i was eating. my advice stop comparing yourself to other people right now. focus on yourself and being healthier and happier. don't hate on yourself if you slip up with your eating habits. also, don't eat your emotions. if you have depression for any reason seek professional help. food will not ease your pain and suffering.</data>

  <data key="d1">i havent. my close friends that ive genuinely trusted before are drifting away. a once bestfriend of mine told me im just a selfpitier and begging for attention and not real help. ive been taken advantage by the help and support i offer and never gotten any in return. ive accepted that people can be just inherently horrible and nobody gives a shit about me or my life. when they need help its a call for support, when i need help its a call for attention. i tried suicide today. but it failed. i want to try it again, but then everyone that doesnt already know that it was an attempt would know. i just want a guaranteed, possibly accidental death at this point.</data>

  <data key="d1">it seems like you are going through a lot right now. from what you wrote, it seems like you feel empty and worthless, but also alienated from your peers. i find it odd that your friends cared enough to take the knife away from you but they didn't check in with you later, but maybe that has something to do with the fact that everyone was high at the time. i am curious how much of your experience was the result of the drugs as someone who used to smoke daily, weed can definitely make you very anxious or of what you are constantly feeling. i would try to stay away from weed and all substances, for that matter regardless, but the context is interesting. it worries me that you tried to kill yourself regardless. i think the fact that you even have friends says a lot about your character. i wonder if you hold yourself to too high of a regard. it is easy to feel empty and like you are worthless if you set your expectations too high. i also understand the flipflopping when it comes to suicide. sometimes i feel like i will never do it, but sometimes i feel like i am slowly eking closer to it. the fact that you attempted self harm and you are typing here at all tells me that you are indeed in need of some form of help. please feel free to reach out. i am always here if you want to chat, whether you want to vent or if you want advise. i am not a therapist, but i am not in the best place myself and i like to try to help people talk through their problems because i can relate and it makes me feel better, so don't feel like you are a burden. i think you are much greater than you perceive yourself to be.</data>

  <data key="d1">yo fuck your parents, be there for your sister, you are 100 old enough to go to any clinic and get help. if you need to and it may be a weight you will have to carry but move out and bring your sister with you if shes willing and give her a good environment. you are old enough to do so but again it would change things, post secondary opportunities but i mean depending on where you are eg canada they would take that into consideration and give you funding so you can provide and go to school without as much stress. wait for someone to do something or do something now to help your sister, it's still not too late. legit be there for her.</data>

  <data key="d1">i started crying as soon as i read this...it sucks that im always the one getting hurt in relationships. this was my 3rd and i foolishly thought things would work out...as much as im glad that hes okay, it feels fucking shitty knowing that hes having the time of his life while im here feeling this way. also, thank you for this. ive always felt so alone knowing that im not alone in this is actually comforting. stay strong. well get through this.</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel you. i couldnt bring myself to block them even after they blocked me first. i eventually blocked them because i realized i couldnt control myself from stalking them and the things i saw were what drove me crazy. please, block him. i felt awful as well, especially because ive told them that i wouldnt block, but you know what, we deserve to make ourselves feel better and letting them know that were, at least seemingly, moving on as well, as a revenge for their quickasshit moveons. even though they most likely dont care anyway lol. fuckkkkk them.</data>

  <data key="d1">i used to feel like this a lot. going through mental health issues really makes you feel like hard work, and it seems like some people can'tdon't want to put in any effort. that doesn't make you a burden though, the people in your life are just not supportive enough. think about if the roles were reversed would you call a friend a burden for struggling like you do?</data>

  <data key="d1">studying ndes has made me understand that we are all loveable, and wellloved. we are made by love, come from love, and unto love return. but we tend to lose track of it here in the 3d world. what do you enjoy? find it and do it. a trick that works for me is to do unexpected, random nice things for people. always improves my mood. and random people benefit too.</data>

  <data key="d1">well, as long as it's not an uncureable illness, a disability that makes life horrible or anything like that, i truely think that shit get's better, cause mental illness is something that you can treat in so many different ways, you just gotta try. it's nobody's fault that they have trauma, depression, etc. think about where you're posting this, cause your post could goddamn motivate people to kill themselves even if they could get better. people are not a hopeless case with mental illness and there really aren't a lot of things that are unsolvable. think about that dude.</data>

  <data key="d1">i just think if someone get a goddamn cancer they should be suffer everyday because others manipulate him that he is selfish if he kill himself. you even agree with me. as i said suicide can be a solution. but first you should think that is the only solution or you have other options. i'm never said that it's somone fault, if they have unlucky life. i'm said that if someone can't get it through should consider suicidieagain if that is the only solution. imagine you are became homeless and you will be hungry everyday. i know you will say it can be better, but what if not? you will suffer everyday until you die. imagine, your family died and you have nothing to live for imagine, you tried to kill yourself but someone saved you. now you can go tomorrow, to your shitty 95 job again. x200b you are half right. i said, someone can get better, but not everyone. be real. some people never get better. the difference between your statment and mine, is i agreed with you. but you are acting like everyone will be better, and hiding the full truth.</data>

  <data key="d1">im so sorry about your dog, and that youll probably always associate your dad with it. have you thought about volunteering at an animal shelter, or fostering? give yourself time to grieve of course. but if you can make a difference in another animals life, your doing your dog an honor.</data>

  <data key="d1">psychology is based on 1960s sentiment which tries to describe the value of psychology as a true science when in truth it is a pseudoscience. it is mostly based on opinions and making unrelated inferences. when i asked a worker i was told, it works on some people but not all people. life does not require joy. joy is the freebase happiness that we all desire and have a hard time acquiring.</data>

  <data key="d1">sorry youre feeling like this. this is my opinion, based on the last three words of your post and a few decades of feeling the same. you need to develop more selfcompassion seems obvious i know. so, how do you do this? many ways to achieve this. i would do as much self help stuff as you can. read up on it, watch online videos, have a go at compassion focussed therapy, if available where you are. come out of your comfort zone and try new stuff. you may stumble on something that you really enjoy. it doesnt matter how you do it, just get that thing in your life that makes you feel proud of yourself and this will snowball and your thoughts will be reversed. selfcompassion is the most important thing in a persons life. solve that conundrum and everything else will fall in place. how do i know because ive gone through it. i have friends but i only have one best friend and thats me. if im alone, it does not matter cos my best mate is with me. if i can do it anyone can.</data>

  <data key="d1">do you think you might be depressed? have you thought of seeing anyone about it? even seeing the school consular could help a lot though maybe it would help to think about what you think is missing from your life and what steps you could take towards it. though school is often pretty boring and inane, just think of it as a stepping stone to better things, and prepare yourself for what you plan to do after, or try new things and see if you can find something that can fit you.</data>

  <data key="d1">this may nit be what you want to hear, and this maybe a blessing in disguise. if the therapist for any reason doesnt want to engage, either because they are not sure they can provide continuity of care or that they are a good match for you to find out sooner than later is good. i have real bad ptsd been in therapy for years, had some real bad therapist that kept trying even thus we were having minimal progress , then i had one who made a lot of progress but fell short of an actionable diagnosis, finally two years ago, i found a therapist who took the time to properly diagnose me and combine my cognitive therapy with a good psychiatrist that provided meds. i hear you is a pain in the ass to open to strangers again and again, and each time you do, it gets easier after time. and you will find the right therapist for you. i hope is sooner than later, and dont give up.</data>

  <data key="d1">i really sorry this happened to you, and i can't imagine how are you feeling right now. it must be hard, really hard. but... it's not over, after all, you're alive, aren't you? even if life kicks you all time, sometimes it gives you wonderful moments. the person who did this to you it's really a piece of shit, and i think you should try talking to a lawyer or someone else due to receive law enforcement. you're not done yet, come on man, you have a long life to live, precious moments to live and nice people to meet, but nothing of this will happen if you end your life. you don't deserve to die as young as you are, i'm really sure and really hope that things get better for you, keep walking in this path called life, the weight to exist is lighter when it's shared, as i said, there is a lot of nice people to meet outside, but you won't do it of you end your life. live on hope, because the world is not as bad as it seems to be.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey man, i dont want you to kill your self... but could you tell me what pills you plan on taking? overdosing is a pretty terrible way to go, especially if you dont have a lot of knowledge in that field. taking some pills may just result in organ damage, that wont kill you, but will be very painful. theres no reason to put yourself in even more pain. honestly, you should probably just go to the hospital and tell them about your situation, so that they can help you. there are mental health emergency centers as well, but theyre not as widely available. please dont take pills in your bathtub just so people understand... im not condoning suicide here. i just dont want him to go through misery for no reason.</data>

  <data key="d1">i always keep asking myself if everything that i'm anxious about is really worth worrying about...i get through a whole day constantly worrying over stupid stuff like how ppl saw me that day and what i did and didn't do, and i keep remembering moments when i was afraid or i was yelled at....and then at the end of the day i'm alone, staring into nothing, realising none of that stuff mattered, yet i still let it ruin my mindset and lead me to dark thoughts</data>

  <data key="d1">i developed anxiety the beginning of this year. they tried to tell me it's mild ptsd. but i know there's something actually wrong with me like a tumor or something. when i get my episodes it's more like i can't breath, i feel really drunk out of no where, stuff gets either super quiet or super loud and i get confused. this has stopped me from being able to enjoy things. can go out with my friends. one time i was watching a movie on a first date with a girl and had to go to the er because i started hypoventilating. so i feel ya. the other night i was laying in bed till 5am during an attack, and just welcomed the dark thoughts in. now it manifested and i've been mindlessly walking around today. i wish i had more positive things to say besides i understand how you feel</data>

  <data key="d1">you know, i don't think people like us need positive things. i think all we seek is understanding. i've realised that when i get too deep in the dark, all i desire is just to hug someone i truly love, because there are these people that make me feel...safe...and secure from the world itself and that sense of security is enough to make me feel actually calm and...free the same feeling that people seek when they commit suicide</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm not trained in suicide prevention but am a high empathy person with informal experience dealing with difficult conversations. in situations where someone is going thru a crisis, my general guidelines are 1 be interested. help them talk it out... if they aren't talking much, they might want you to ask questions to see if you really care before they share deeper emotions. keep asking them about their feelings and respond with positivity. 2 support, agree, or understand what makes them feel that way. express it. never contradict, argue or tell them they're wrong. 3 unless they ask about you or how you feel about a certain thing, 95 of the conversation should be about them and how they feel. focus the conversation back to them. when their emotions turn for the better, then you can add positive stories or experiences that relate. 4 since you're friends, be authentic. don't give the canned advice they would hear from a hotline like it'll get better, you have so much to live for, etc. if they wanted that, they would call a hotline. they are talking to you because they want a friend. 5 listen intently. never cut them off. repeat some of the details of what they told you in your questioning or responses. this will let them know the most important issue in their life is being heard 6 when you do speak to cheer someone up, do it with visualizations of something very positive, or remind them of shared good times in the past. 7 let them end the conversation, not you. i imagine you are busy... but if they are pouring out what they consider the most important thing in their life, all the help you give them will be lost if they perceive that you consider something else more important than listening to them. it's about improving their perception of self value. ppl with damaged self esteem will likely say i've wasted enough of your time, you don't have to listen to me anymore, etc. the first time they say that, respond with i cleared my evening, this is important to me. or, everything else can wait, i want to hear more about what's bothering you. when they're truly done, they'll be assertive in ending the conversation. until then they may just be measuring how much you care. if you absolutely have to go, tell them you want to continue the conversation and ask them when they're free tomorrow. 8 since you're doing video chat, look at them the whole time. don't get distracted by noises. put away your phone, etc... the one thing they need right now is love. by being authentic, interested and showing them they are valued is how to get it across. good luck and thank you for what you're doing for your friends. just being there makes a huge impact. remember that some things can't be fixed but can be made more comfortable.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey man, seriously dont give up. i had chronic pain in my back and my leg. i used to fantasize about having my leg removed. i tried everything to make it better like going to a back clinic and doing all of the exercises they recommended, went to numerous specialists, osteopathic therapy, different physical therapists, medications, etc. after all of that struggle i finally found a physical therapist who had me stretch, lose weight, and just a few specific exercises and now i feel amazing. pain is still there but not to the point that its driving me literally insane. my point is....keep searching and dont give up! and i hope you too can find that right treatment that can help you. as far as only being with one girl and having a small penis...well u r lucky because you have the internet as a resource and there are tons and tons of woman who are looking for a man who is small. there is a niche for everyone and i bet men like you are in a much higher demand than you think. plus people are finally starting to embrace uniqueness and that's what they are looking for and it sounds like you have some very beautiful unique qualities. you need to own those qualities. the power of laughter is amazing so seek out what makes you laugh and dont give up. i'm guessing that's the last thing you want to do but give it a try.</data>

  <data key="d1">one of the things i realize is that most us choose to act like everthing is fine as a cope mechanism on our depreassive state or keeping ourselves busy to distract us, thats why i try to be sympathetic to anyone even they are not showing any signs of problems or struggle, who know what battle we are all fighting in our mind.</data>

  <data key="d1">well, parties have music, or was it just maybe all the ruckus and energy of the party..? either way, maybe it's triggered by energetic, lively things in general. maybe your environment has to be calmserene, in order for you to not get a headache. i'm no biologist, but try checking with your doctor. i'll see what i can find.</data>

  <data key="d1">you have your wife and i'm sure you'll find someone to take car of the animals. the issues you are having suck but their are 100000s of people in your country that went through the same thing and survived. life is dependent on your experiences and you have every right to feel distressed but i would cut out an eye just to hope to be someday where you are now. the obvious first step is to swallow your pride and ask for help wherever you can. go to subs dedicated to your financial troubles to get some advice on debt management, go trough the bureaucratic shite to apply for any help you can get and go hug your wife. troubles like this and how we deal them might kill the one thing that is unconditional, the love between you 2. everything else can improve. if homeless junkies can get their life's back together, i'm sure you can too.</data>

  <data key="d1">i read that between the lines. i've never been married but this situation is very common that's why i wrote this. most relationships either grow really strong or break apart in situations like this. i don't know your wife but i would talk to her with 100 transparence. resentment is normal in situations like this and you have too much ahead of you to hinder each other. you can be each others anchors and even live happy lives no matter the financial situation or you blame each other. maby you even decide to go your own way but you both need to know that you can rely each other and not just add to the pain and problems. i wish you all the best and feel free to contact me if you want someone to talk to.</data>

  <data key="d1">i don't know what to say but i will say this, i can see alot of myself in you and the exact words you call yourself, i call myself every single day.. literally every single word.. i just want you to not feel alone.. everyone deserves happiness however bad they are.. i am a terrible human but that doesn't mean i deserve this internal maelstrom of emotions and apathy i am faced with.. what i'm getting to is, life is suffering.. but i'd rather suffer together than suffer alone. by suffering together i mean acknowledging that i'm not the only one who feels the same way.. millions of people are conflicted with selfhatred and depression so i find comfort in the fact that i'm not alone.. try introducing positive thoughts in your mind however hard it is.. just praise yourself for trying that's all..</data>

  <data key="d1">it's normal to be reeling after a close relationship ends, take some time to grieve the loss of it but don't tell yourself you can't be happy with anyone else, even if it feels true it isn't true, lots of people break up with someone they are sure is the one and eventually go onto meet someone else who returns their feelings, though that doesn't mean what you're going through now doesn't hurt.. maybe it would help to spend some time with friends or family?</data>

  <data key="d1">keep in mind, you will ruin your mother's life, especially if you have lived with her since the beginning. it's not just yours at stake here. if you caused her so much suffering, then she wouldn't let you live there. you are way too young for this shit, you haven't even moved out to live your own life yet, you've lived not even 13 of your life. you will be nothing if you say you are nothing, simple as that. you insult yourself, expect to feel like shit. call yourself useless, well you're going to feel useless. you say it's too late, it's going to feel that way. doesn't mean any of this is true in the slightest, you just believe it to be true. wake the fuck up and realize you have a selfcreated negative narrative of yourself. and don't even say you didn't do it because every single person creates a selfimage, and though it is influenced by the world, it only influences you as much as you let it. i would say get help, but you have to help yourself if that's going to work, and you don't seem keen on realistic solutions, just the dumb ones like suicide.</data>

  <data key="d1">youre confused. everything has moved to fast for you. im currently in high school and not thinking of going to college for the right reasons. i believe my teachers when they say that college isnt for anyone but, i would say go to community college and try to be more open. youre starting off clean on a new slate. i was like you in middle school and when high school rolled around i tried to be more open, joined the wrestling and soccer team. i actually have something other than clash royale to do all day.</data>

  <data key="d1">yea ive lost motivation for damn near everything recently and am confused asf too, idk if im depressed or stressed but... killing yourself is never an option, regardless of what your going through theres always people out there that will miss you when your gone, even if you dont think so. im nervous for my future too kind of overwhelmed by it but everyone probably is. and you should be looking forward to whats coming in the future, not scared of it, because at the end of the day being alive is better than being dead 1010 times , think about all the good things that have happened in life that wouldnt have if you would have been dead... theres so many things to look forward too instead of looking down upon, be grateful that your not dead, and that you get to live another day on earth, shouldnt be focused on that math test you failed, or your crush that gave you the wrong look today, be yourself, focus on what makes you happy and the goals you want to achieve, then go get those goals, and dont let anyone stop u because at the end of the day its your life, and you control how it goes, start looking at the better outcome of every situation, and it helps you appreciate life more. im here for you same w everyone else on this thread man</data>

  <data key="d1">a big problem i have is that i can't do anything, any activity i take becomes increasingly more difficult as i continue it. this is the reason i've dropped out of school, it's the reason i ghosted all my friends, and it's also the reason i spend all day in bed doing absolutely nothing. any new activity i manage to pick up will last a max of about 2 weeks, but on average barely lasts a day. i just don't have the motivation to keep finding new things. what i'm hoping for is that my therapy or medication makes it easier to do these things, so hopefully i can slowly get my life back.</data>

  <data key="d1">some people find relief in it because they see it as punishing themselves or they want to distract themselves from the pain of life or quite simply some people are just addicted to it. i can say personally that after you start it becomes a craving and an addiction let alone a coping mechanism. this way of coping brings with it many repercussions, it can make you feel worse about yourself after the deed is done as it is a constant reminder of your broken nature. or if others who also cut or used to cut see it it can make them relapse. overall, i personally used to rely on it a lot and would cut in places people wouldnt see. but upon reflection, it doesnt really solve anything or help, overtime you feel the need to go deeper and deeper and eventually end up doing permanent damage or creating ugly scars. i would recommend instead having a cold shower, wearing a rubber band on your wrist and flicking it, punching yourself, an ice cube or even doing some form of exercise. mentally i like to visualize myself leaving my body and rising to look at the world as a whole so that i can see how much the future holds for me and how what im feeling now can be diminished. i hope this helped in some way. obviously when you try to quit you relapse so im still learning to cope with my problems in a healthier way</data>

  <data key="d1">it's mixed for me. cutting for me has become a way to distract myself from the emotional pain. i can tend to a physical wound much easier than to my hurt feelings. the deeper i go, the better the distraction at the same time though, it causes me to bottle up my emotions. i don't like cutting but see it as the only effective coping mechanism. because of this i am scared to feel sad so i ignore and suppress all my negative emotions until it all spills over one day and the cycle repeats</data>

  <data key="d1">cutting feels so so good in the moment. its like a release of that mess building up in your mind into manageable lines on your wrist. the pain feels so good, exactly what i need in that moment to become aware of something other than the internal pain. the only thing is that the lines dont go away even after the thoughts that made you cut go away. so you constantly have to hide them or find weak excuses to prevent people from getting concerned. i guess its a temporary relief but the consequences can be permanent. the questions, selfconsciousness, anonymous reports to the school counselorthat personally was enough to make me stop.</data>

  <data key="d1">cutting helps in the moment. they will start off as small cuts and you will think you are in control, but they get bigger, the scars get uglier and messier then years later when you eventually think you are beginning to feel better, youre left with hundreds of reminders all over your body. youre literally a prisoner and you feel ten times worse than before and theres nothing you can do about it. its just another problem not a solution to a problem.</data>

  <data key="d1">there's absolutely no way that i can afford therapy out of pocket. i've called around to try to find community resources to see if anybody would be willing to work on a cash only basis or even apply to somewhere that might be willing to cover it but it seems like the community is lacking mental health resources for those who need it as well.</data>

  <data key="d1">well i'm really sensitive, so anything can bother me tbh. i was talking with my brother earlier and i just wanted to leave because i was starting get uncomfortable. i wanted to cry. it's not his fault, i just get want to cry when it feels like i'm being interrogated. he then told me that he doesn't care about me. i've always felt that nobody cared about me, but i always told myself that it was just my negative thoughts doing that. i definitely got hurt when i heard that sentence come out of his mouth instead of hearing in my head.</data>

  <data key="d1">give it a try! you literally have nothing to lose if you're going to kill yourself. in a way it's kind of liberating... you can live and try new things, start again knowing there's no real commitment.... it could change everything. that possibility exists, even if it is small. go for it, you may be surprised. get help with someone that understands you situation bro, a single year could change your life completely. don't let your experiences of the past keep you from seeing the possibilities in the future. there's no shame in asking for help, we're all dealt the life we have and try to make the best of it. we all fuck up. give yourself a chance at a life, even happiness? you deserve it and there is always a route there, even though it might be buried fucking deep under all the clutter. here to talk</data>

  <data key="d1">it's a tough cycle to get out of but if you are desperate for love, you will never really get it. i know alot of ppl will say oh you have to love yourself, but sometimes you just dont. so the only other thing to do i guess is to love others selflessly and not expect or want it back. eventually karma catches up.</data>

  <data key="d1">i can partly agree with you because i'm part of the lgbtq community too. sometimes i think i'm too young to know this so i'm so confused about it. i would give everything to be normal too, but i think there's nothing anyone could do anything about it. i'm sure that you will find someone. you can't have a biological child but in many countries you can adopt one. i know it's not the same but i think that's pretty nice too. so all i can say is don't give up! when you feel alone or something, remember there's a lot of other people like you in the world.</data>

  <data key="d1">you are wrong so very wrong because you are not alone. there are millions of homosexuals in every country of the world even those who's citizens are very homophobic where homosexuals are being killed by angry mobs of people. if you feel shame try not to show in public that you are gay as to not get any unwanted attention. i know hiding yourself should not be necessary but you can't change others but you can avoid them and their responses. why do you feel you need a traditional family? i ask myself that when i feel sad for not finding a woman and i can't answer it. my only vague guess is that some animalistic part of our brain wants us to procreate. i always felt ugly but after some time this feeling went away because i learnt to accept myself as what i am. it took me a long time maybe 1015 years. you need to give yourself time to accept what you are because once you do you will be happy.</data>

  <data key="d1">coming from a straight man, i am very sorry you deal with those assholes and communities that betray what is only natural in human life. there is nothing wrong with you and only everything wrong with the way people act. so many judge others because they can't judge themselves because any and everyone of them have worse problems and refuse to acknowledge. i wish the best for you and hope you realize your life is way more important than any of there's who wish to look down upon what they don't understand. my wife's family has a few gay aunts and a sister who is now married to her better half. i personally see nothing wrong with it and wish that you can see beyond the ignorance of the assholes out there. my biggest strength is being me and not letting anyone affect my life. i am uniquely different and my own person and have been blessed to never fear the judgement of others for what i beleive and follow my own thoughts please consider yourself unique and special no matter what you are because you are special and nothing wrong with that.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey man, i know exactly what youre going through. i say the same thing to myself constantly. like you, i would give my right arm and both kidneys to be straight, id make a deal with the devil, id never leave the cave, id do so many things just to be straight today. maybe not even straight, id take bisexual or even asexual. i dont know how it is for the straight crowd, but in my experience, the community of gay men today is completely caught up in the optics and the medias definition of what a gay man should be great body, great outlook, nothing ever bothers them. i cant be lumped into a group like that when i have zero chance of being as perfect as that. thankfully and realistically, this isnt the case for 90 of the community. hell, my parents dont even accept me, and because of this virus im forced to live with their preachy attitudes and moral soapboxing. they really only let me back in the house since covid19 is in full swing, there are no alternatives and i guess im as grateful as i can be for that. i am in no way telling you to feel better or be happier, because frankly theres no reason to right now. everything really does suck right now, especially if you live in a lockdown state. ive also certainly wanted to die a hell of a lot these last couple of weeks. i dont really know what to say besides maybe my story will help you find some solace that others are also going through the same bullshit as you. i dont know if that helps, but its my best shot. heres to hoping 2020 doesnt fuck us worse than it already has.</data>

  <data key="d1">brother, i'm straight, but i have many gay family members and friends that i knew while i was living in small towns throughout the midwest and south before moving to a larger city. most of them felt like you, at least during certain periods of their lives. most of them have become successful and live happy lives that anybody could envy now. from what they tell me and from what i've observed, it took them getting out of the smaller towns and going to larger cities where there are gay communities and groups and clubs and people are just generally more accepting than in rural areas. what size city or town do you live in? if it's a redneck shithole, work towards moving to an urban area if possible. other than that, just know that you have plenty of straight allies and millions of fellow gays out there. you're not alone!</data>

  <data key="d1">i understand so much of what you're saying. i'm a trans woman. i did my best to try to live my life without transitioning, but if lead to either an early death or being honest with myself about who i am. i decided to take the leap and go for it. it will always be the hardest thing i ever did, but i'm alive and while it does suck that i deal with transphobia occasionally and it can be a little harder finding a guy to be with, it doesn't mean my life isn't worth living. it's not easy to get to that point, but the more you work towards accepting that you're life is valid and important, the easier it gets. i'm not always there myself, but i can tell you i'm thankful for every extra year i have that i can be myself. i really hope one day you feel the same.</data>

  <data key="d1">realizing you're a worthless disappointment to your parents, that you betrayed them. this really jumped out at me, for two reasons. a i'm a parent, and i would honestly welcome a gay child b i know three men with gay children one of them is a minister in the dutch reformed church he and his wife adore their boy, the second person marched with their child in gay pride the child confided to me that i'm so pleased and proud my father wants to march with me, but i'd really rather he didn't! he's going to cramp my style! and the third couple'sr 40yr old lives with them and they are still having such fun even during lockdown!. so if your parents do not love and accept you, know in your heart that they betray you, not the other way around.</data>

  <data key="d1">am not gay myself. but i can understand most of the problems you mentioned other than that. i am straight, but didn't never found it easier to find anyone. have been living alone for years and been tired of it alot. suicidal thoughts seemed intermittent but latest spread of coronavirus has made suicidal thoughts slightly regular. recent self growth has been that i chose to see what the future would hold for me. have put a small full stop to my suicidal thoughts and decided to go ahead and meet my problems and weakness head on. our struggles might not be same, but i hope our decision of holding onto our life can be same. please feel free to talk and discuss anything you want. might not be able to give any advice but can lend a ear for sure.</data>

  <data key="d1">there's plenty of people you can potentially date, there's gay people everywhere. if you live in a small city it's harder but not impossible. you could move to a bigger city. adopted kids are still your kids, don't fall into the mindset that only biological children are your real family. they are just as rewarding as any other family. and you didn't betray your parents, as a trans guy i understand the sentiment but i didn't ask to be born, no one did, so to put expectations on someone who isn't even born yet is nothing short of insane. no parents should demand grandchildren, especially if they don't accept you for who you are. if that's the case i hope you can cut them out of your life.</data>

  <data key="d1">honestly didn't know this was still a problem, and atleast now i know it is. everyone that i know of doesn't think about gay people in an a different way, they don't treat them worse or better just from their orientation just equal, at least they say so. but i see what you mean about the limited dating pool as all the men i know are straight themselves, and imo everyone wants a biological family tree, everyone secretly wants descendants, someone to keep the family name and blood. but that doesn't mean it has to be different i love my adopted nephews as much as the rest. this probably want help, but this is my outlook on the points you made. i'm not pretending that i understand you though, i'm not in your position and will never be so i hope it's something you can overcome</data>

  <data key="d1">wow this has a looott of replies so i'll add mine and hope it will help try not to overthink things. it might seem tough now, but you are who you are. being gay or not doesn't define you. you are your own person, that has a sexual preference towards the same sex. not a gay person with some other inferior qualities. whatever happens remind yourself that. to your family it might be difficult to accept it but at the end of the day it's none of their business who you bring to your bed unless if it is an underage person which is wrong or who you want to start a family and fall in love with. try your best with everything else in your life and i'm sure you will end up with someone wonderful one day. lots of love, a stranger from redit! xx</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, honestly, let me tell you i'm so damaged from my childhood that i literally can't date at all any way even though i'm straight. and also my family hates me too because that's just how they are but what i've realized is how much better off we are without those people who make us feel bad about ourselves. you can't control that you were born gay. and nothing is wrong with being gay! as long as you're attracted to other consenting adults with a similar intellect to yours then no one has any right whatsoever to make you feel so badly about who you were born as. i know you care because you love them and so it hurts that they treat you like you're a bad person but you're doing nothing wrong and have to love yourself. you're so much more than people's homophobic opinions. you won't find happiness, it'll find you. i hope life gets easier for you very soon and don't let anyone tell you that you're less because you're gay. there is nothing wrong with being attracted to the same gender as yourself.</data>

  <data key="d1">you're not a worthless disappointment to anybody. and anyone who feels that way about you isn't worth thinking about as their opinions mean nothing. it really is worth distancing yourself from that kind of toxicity, even if it means moving to another country if you're in a less accepting one. being gay is just that. it really shouldn't have to be that much different from being straight. now i can relate on the smaller dating pool. and the people you do find can be so immature, choosy and a complete waste of time. but straights deal with that too. just accept yourself and don't try to be what you're not because you cannot change your sexuality. and believe me it is not worth stressing about. anyone who has a problem with you because of it, that is their problem. it is. nobody homophobic has any value or importance, they probably say and think a lot of other stupid shit that makes them a terrible person. they're the disappointments, not you.</data>

  <data key="d1">honestly being in a straight relationship isn't all that great either. if your parents are like i think they are it wouldn't matter is you were straight they'd still find something to be disappointed about and angry. you don't have to be gay to get bullied either. people hate people for all kinds of reasons and homophobia is just another excuse for someone with hate to spread that hate farther. people hate people cause they're ugly. people hate people cause they're good looking. talented. talentless. fat. thin. promiscuous. faithful. it doesn't matter what you are there will be someone somewhere with an excuse to be mean. i dont know what to define my sexuality really but i have male fiance. my parents know i like girls but they choose not to want to talk about it. i don't know what your going through. i wish i could comfort you somehow. my son is 4 and growing up i will accept him loving whomever he wants as long as they do right by him. i'm sorry your having such a hard time. but the reality is having a normal family isn't actually normal anymore. most families are divorced now a days. i don't think i know of a single normal family. my dad is hetero but he's been divorced 4 times and can't keep a gf. i was raised by my grandma because the woman he had me with was an abusive pedo and he was too young to take care of me. being gay or not doesn't matter. it isn't your sexuality that'll make you happy it's who you are with that'll make you happy. even if it's just you with yourself. even if you somehow became hetero there's no guarantee your life would be any better. your parents might accept you then but then again they might find some other thing to hate about you. you loving yourself is all that matters. accepting yourself for who you are and finding people who do the same are important. just because you were born to your parents doesn't make them family. family loves unconditionally. a stranger you've only known for 5 mins could turn out to be better family than your own. you never know. i know it probably isn't worth much coming from me but i'm proud of you for being who you are. for living each day. even getting out of bed is a small accomplishment.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey man, i'm a trans guy, and i get it. i would kill someone to be cis. being trans is hell. the media only show the decent side to it, but for me there is no decent side. it's constant bullying and family members and friends rejecting you and hearing constant stories about trans people getting beaten to death just because they exist. then there's gender dysphoria. i don't know how to describe it, but the best i can do is constantly feeling like you want to tear your skin off because you don't look the way you're supposed to, and other people don't get it because they think you're trying to be a special snowflake and that you're choosing this. looking into a mirror feels like you're having a panic attack. i've accepted i'm going to be alone forever because no one wants to be with a tranny. i don't feel attraction towards women, but i can't call myself gay because gay guys don't want me, and because i'm not a real guy. people glorify being lgbt, but for some of us it's fucking hell on earth. one someone knows you're lgbt, that's all you are to them. my family have rejected me, i have very few friends, and i fucking hate myself. i get where you're coming from. i hope things get better for you man</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel the exact same way. i question the useful of my existence being that i serve no purpose to the advancement of the human race. when i see comments on why people like me deserve to be tortured, i wonder if they are right. my sexuality is very isolating. i know there are other gay people but its still so lonely. i hope you dont die or do something to harm yourself. im just here to tell you that i hear you that you arent alone.</data>

  <data key="d1">nope. the possible side effects are pretty standard. they get scared because its similar to the stimulant adderal in what it does. thing is though it isnt related at all. it isnt a stimulant and does not contain any amphetamines. its probably actually safer than the anti depressants ive been given already.</data>

  <data key="d1">i haven't yet and that's a good point. the university offers an appeals process that students can use to alter an university decision e.g. deregistration in my case. however, for me, i've gone through the process before i have repeated my final year and the university explicitly stated that this will be the last attempt. i'll keep going, but the chances are grim.</data>

  <data key="d1">please consider it! you have come so far, invested so much and learned more than most of us. the last thing your university will want you to do is throw that away and they wont suggest it. theres been people in shittier education situations than you who have been helped on to a path with suits them. im confident your advisor will help you figure out if this path is right and if so how to get back on it or if theres anything else youd rather be doing. let yourself mourn for awhile and look after yourself. but do try to get gears turning. if theres anything i can do, any emails i could compose or send because youre lacking the spoons please let me know.</data>

  <data key="d1">dont give up just yet. im sure theres something left for you, lets say you do fail that spanish class, it doesnt mean your life is over, a grade doesnt define who you are. its just a number. you can do so many things in life without having to ever worry about grades. grades dont make a person. i think with your familial situation you should and i know its hard, to do this just let your parents say whatever they want, let them yell at you for hours, but dont give any of their words a thought. if your mom is just bullying you, just tell her so. if you dad doesnt want to help you and doesnt stand up for you or himself then clearly you cant take his advice seriously. im sorry that you have to go though all this but i promise you theres always light at the end of the tunnel. i dont know id youre religious but i am and i pray that you, your mother, and your father can find peace with each other in someway or another and that you keep on keeping on.</data>

  <data key="d1">you and your story hold close to my heart. at 17 to 18 years old, almost that entire year i spent locking myself in my room and building up enough courage to end the life of pain around me. it was endless. and it was only two years ago. pretty insane how at such an early age we can be ready to leave this lifetime behind because that's how painful it really is. you're growing into a new age with a life you've never lived before. this is the part of adulthood most don't get told about. and when you're just starting, if it's not explained or shown to you, it can be very misleading and depression can start to take control. things don't get better but you start to understand the ways depression manifests and works, which relives a ton of greif and stress, that's the part that gets better. you learn more. you find tools to defend yourself against it. it's not normal or fair for you to go through the pain you do or i did. but the feelings you have about it are certainly normal. it's when we learn how to process these feelings around our own mind, that we can start to live a life without greif. i hope you don't die but i wouldnt blame you if you did friend. it's fucking painful. but just know it does get better. because you learn what this is. it's just how we proccess our lives and emotions which, alot of it in your posts you were right about. again, it's just how we proccess these things and those who have been down this journey can certainly help. those things take time. hang on if you can. it's worth it i promise you. i love you for making it this far. pain unfortunately builds you up as a person. as much as it seems to bring us down. if you can hang on it will come back for you in the long run.</data>

  <data key="d1">that's fine, it isnt intruding. but i dont really want to talk that much about it. i'm very tired rn lol. but anyways. i've just been immensely depressed for about half a decade now. and to be honest, it wasnt that bad for a year, it was just standard lack of enjoyment. eventually i just felt like i overcame it. but i was wrong, dead wrong. whatever the hell this is came back more potent than last time. and up to now, i can't stop thinking about meaninglessness, futility, death, suicide, my impact on the world, and just like, how much better off people would be if i just ceased to exist in everyones memory once i die. and it always just gets worse. i'm genuinely hoping i fail highschool, get either kicked out or move out. probably go far up north. and then just end my existence there. nobody that i know of would find me. and i'd be at peace knowing they'd never have to see my body, ever. and just, the lust i have for nonexistence, complete obliteration. because at this point, i know the pain will never end, even if i die. but it's better than having others press on my conscience, whether or not they intend too. and to be frank. 17 years isnt that bad of a run. i mean, it was all pointless, but it's just how the world works. the greats get greater, and the pointless get more pointless.</data>

  <data key="d1">i havent been living the life of someone who wants to live that there says a lot. there's a way of living that isn't living. this is not, kinda selfevidently, a positive way to live. one websiteresource compared suicide to jumping out of a burning building, and it stuck with me it's more that people don't want to be in pain than that they want to die, however, the extent to which they see the pain changing or the building being on fire without jumping is what makes suicide the option. if there are firemen, that could be useful. if there's water, that's useful, and so on. you really seem like you want to have a future, to live, and not seeing a future life for yourself is taking that desire away because . . . desires that you can't place anywhere or act on can freaking hurt. i really hope that something else becomes an option for you ending your own life, i really hope that you can simply . . . have a different life. or, a different environment that lets you life your life comfortably.</data>

  <data key="d1">suicide watch i totally feel you. ive felt that way most of my life. my dad was a psychopath therapist by day who abused me emotionally, physically and sexually. my mom was depressed and spent most of my childhood on the couch watching the weather channel. ive discovered through reading about trauma that, when we dont get enough love and nurturing as a child, we never learn to love and nurture ourselves. so i spent my whole life looking for love in other people and things and success. i never knew that all i need and the only one who can save me is me. i just am learning to be the kind and loving parent that i never had. its wild and totally against everything i believed my whole life...but what i believed was leading me to desperately kill myself, so i guess its worth letting it go and trying something new. its the only way life has any meaning for me...getting to know my inner child and being my own good parent</data>

  <data key="d1">i have one way of dying but i never really went that far because of my bodys natural desire to survive. i was pretty close though in november 2019. you really do see how pathetic people can be when youre suicidal. theyll only be your friend so you dont kill yourself, they think sending you to a psych ward or paying over 100 for a one hour session with some therapist whos job it is to listen helps. talking isnt going to solve anything. if you could give me 6000 to help with my goals then yeah youre helping me a lot actually. but just telling me life is good isnt going to work because my life sucks and thinking about other people isnt going to work either because not only do i not care about anyone but then id just be alive for the sake of others. you have no control of your life. all ill say to you is i hope you find peace wherever you go even if it means death</data>

  <data key="d1">it's normal to feel somewhat lost when you're young. its definitely possible to change, 20s is all about deciding who you want to be and what matters to you and how you can get there. even in your mid late 20s it's ok to still be searching, though maybe you should start thinking about what you want long term. people don't suddenly figure out how to adult when they hit 18, there's a lot of stumbling and self examination involved. don't think you have to 180 all at once, just focus on a little bit at a time. try new stuff, see what fits. maybe take aptitudes tests and think about where your strengths might lie. though sometimes you have to try new things until you find something that can fit don't give up on yourself</data>

  <data key="d1">life is hard. life is so damn ugly and beautiful but the second before you die, you will regret it. parents can cause you to do dumb things etc. their words hurt the most because i guess its a your their kid thing. i dont like saying this since im not sure how abusive she is but running away or calling for help is best. staying with a friend for example. but you do not want to get stabbed sweety or get hungry til u see your bones. its horrible i know but whats the point in life if all you look forward to is getting kidnapoed and drowned,killed. no! you can find some way. im not sure what type of abuse it is but i mean im just a teenager too. or idk younge. but youll figure it out. death isnt worth it if you're going to die at the end of your journey anyway. live this one life. live it with craziness, do dumb stuff, but not on yourself. take care and stand up for yourself</data>

  <data key="d1">oh no beatings? i'm from the us, but even emotional abuse would be tough for the police to take seriously. the police took me away because they knew i had been beaten and they saw how i shook in fear when my parents approached. i don't know your country. in my case this is was many years ago, and i wasn't sure myself if they might not send me back as physical punishment was a lot more common then. thankfully they didn't. it may be worth the risk over living on the streets or suicide. another alternative may be if you can start working and saving so you can live independently asap. but yeah, if your mom is just calling you stupid, lazy, good for nothing whatever, sadly there are few police in the world that would help. you need to be able to tell she isn't giving you proper food and clothes, medicine, or beatings i'm afraid.</data>

  <data key="d1">there are other alternatives rather than cutting yourself. trust me, so manyyy other alternatives rather than hurting yourself. i hate to hear and see people cutting themselves, its not worth it, it makes me sad, regardless whether i dont know you personally. open up a diary on your phone or whether a notebook in real life. draw your emotions onto some piece of paper, spill your emotions on those pieces, let it flow. this works because ive been where you were and i know that painful feeling. i hated it. but now i hate these scars that i have, i have to cover it up. i never thought about the consequences of my actions after cutting myself. i draw and write how i feel. i hope you can do the same or find a better alternative which doesnt involve hurting yourself. i doubt the people hate you this much. youre loved and you dont know. i am a stranger, and i want to help you out. take care of yourself for me! please.</data>

  <data key="d1">giving advice is sometimes not the best thing to do and sometimes even counterproductive. you also can't make him listen to you. all you can do is offer to listen to him. tell him that you care very much and that he can talk to you if he wants. try not to give unsolicited advice. it hasn't worked so far and it probably won't in the future.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi, thank you so, so much for all the details responses and all the tips. you made a lot of analogies that really hit me. i'll keep all those tips in mind when it'll be day again. the situation is a bit complicated, he lives in the united kingdom whereas i'm from france so, cultural and linguistic differences may interfere with the problem.. but i'm still in touch with him so i'll see if i can message him keeping all this in mind within the space of 4 hours i've read so much that i probably need to write stuff down to not mess up. i'm still continuing my research to see how i can talk this out with all the limitations and barriers there are. again, i'm keeping this advice in mind and will do what is good to do. you're a great person for writing a reply this long and for your dedication. thank you.</data>

  <data key="d1">hello, it seems like you are incredibly lonely because its difficult for you to make friends. feeling like you dont have support must be incredibly painful. it also seems like your scared to ask your parents to let you see a therapist. this all must be incredibly painful and i can see why youd feel hopeless in your situation. if i can give a quick tip, if the main reason youre afraid to ask your parents for a therapist is because you fear facing them face to face, you could write a letter and give it to them, or send an email. whatever works best for you. i definitely think therapy could be helpful for you and i think reaching out to your family for help would be an incredibly brave and admirable thing to do</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, i know that you feel like your life is destroyed, but just because one relationship didnt work out doesnt mean that youre not worthy of love. im sure youre a beautiful person both inside and out, and you deserve happiness. youll find other people to love. if you hit the quit button now, your future friends, future partners, will never meet you. youll never get to experience your next love. you can overcome the heartbreak. itll make you stronger, and youll find someone else who appreciates you and loves you more than anything on this planet.</data>

  <data key="d1">you are never to old to start again. if you are not fulfilled, it will manifest in depression. life is too short to go against the grain and commit to something you hate. if i were you, finish your masters, work for a couple years, and save money you can then dedicate to something you really want to do. i am 41. spent 20 years at various companies being an assistant. hated every second of it. now i'm going to pursue a job working with autistic children. it's never too late to pivot. i have 25 years left till i retire. that's a long time to do something i hate... so i decided to change course, and i think i will be happier. pursue your passion and find your bliss.</data>

  <data key="d1">believe it or not the point of life is to be a beam of love and hope for yourselves and others. sounds trite, but that is what i believe. i'm still working on it... not going to uni in no way dictates that you will get a bad job. but you do have to learn a skill. and you do have to be confident. some of the people in my family that didn't go to a 4 year uni work in it, and in nursing. they have a 2 year degrees and not only have no student loan debt, but are homeowners and have families they support. uni is but one direction and in my opinion, a very expensive one that has set up a generation of students to commit to crippling debt while offering no guarantees. i have a 4 year degree and it didn't serve me well. if i had to do it again i would have worked on my social skills, my computer skills and my networking skills, while creating a portfolio. that would have served me better at a tiny fraction of the cost.</data>

  <data key="d1">appreciate getting to see what someone in my situation thinks and feels. what drove me this far? im not sure myself. i guess i have to tell you my story i'll keep it as short as possible. i always was a pretty emotionally tough guy. nothing would be able to get me down. i always recovered. if someone said something mean to me i always just ignored it and carried on with my life. that was how it used to be, now how i got to my current situation. it all started in january 2019. i noticed that i was feeling very dissociated, i felt as if nothing was real. i also occasionally had short episodes of delusion which i still cant explain. they lasted for a few hours and happened about once a month. in mid april, my mother got diagnosed with cancer. this caused my already unstable mind to go into complete shutdown resulting in a 4 week psychotic episode. i was given quite a lot of anti psychotics and i slowly returned to normal practically in the same weekend my psychosis ended, i suddenly felt incredibly strong urges to hurt myself. i've had these in the past last time when i was 12, but they never were as intense. i had these intrusive thoughts that would urge me to hurt myself pretty badly. i didn't want to do it but i felt like i had to. my therapists diagnosed it as ocd. every day was a struggle. every second of every day i had to keep myself from hurting myself. it was way way worse than the psychosis. i was so scared and in shock. i was the happiest when i didn't feel like breaking any bones. yes it was that bad. long story short that also passed. a few months after that happened, i began to feel extremely anxious about exams and tests and school in general. i never felt that way before. it came out of the blue. suddenly i started to dread everything that was going to happen in the future for no apparent reason. i guess something broke inside of me from the agonizing months before. i'll keep this short. this all lead me to be suicidal, landing me in a mental ward. i was released a week later, had a relapse in january 2020 that i didn't tell anyone about didn't even come remotely as close as i did a few hours ago. 2 weeks ago i became suicidal and depressed, i wasn't able to study anything for the upcoming final exams which resulted in a vicous cycle. wasn't able to study became more depressed was even less able to study became suicidal ... and now we're here. tldr had too many psychological problems in 2019 causing me to break and get suicidal and depressed quickly.</data>

  <data key="d1">stress is a bitch. i procrastinated and didnt learn for my exams and then spent the nigth befor a test and learned 400 pages and got through somehow not alway in the first try but i took all my exams. my family was financially supporting me very well but man... i was useless in their eyes when i wasnt getting 100100 we arent even asian!. it started when i was going crazy at 7 because my parents were fighting and police and knifes under the pillow and me standing there crying for them to stop. that damaged me a little. i started pulling out my hair still do sometimes and i even know the medical term for it got a psychological evaluation in which an iq test was included and scored 144 tldr test at this age are shit and do say diddly dick about iq but my parents were cracking the wip from then on. hair pulling and all that stuff is also a compulsive dissorder since you are compelled to do it to relaxavoid some higher punishment some people have to do stuff 3x or they fear god will end the world. tldr i ended punching through my bathroom drywall in 3 places because i was so fucking happy and got hospitalised. i just had to defend my bachelors thesis but i was fucking done with everything 2 years befor that point. not just my regualr chronic depression but i was weighing below 60kg at a height of 1.85m mom said i looked like fresh out of a concentration camp but at least they got shit done stress leads to fear and fear leads to avoiding scarry situations which lead to stagnation which leads to stress. my mother had some growth in her lower abdomen and got stuff removed but told me she will die from cancer soon. she lied or more likely she was more toxic then the cancer so cancer fucked off i told her she should have had the courage to die from her imagined cancer but i digress. there were times where i had commenting voices in my head that were liek toughts that didnt feel like my own. not the burn down this chruch kinda roughts that you see in movies but just making snark comments about life and stuff i saw look at that guy in the wheelchair he is truely misserable and not you. i wasnt really psychotic but that scared the shit out of me. i was struggling with suicide and now i had to fight the demons over the control of my head?! wtf? luckily it went away when i got therapy and just less stress.</data>

  <data key="d1">its good to try and do your best and despite i quit my bachelors i am not a quitter so do your best but if its killing you then you have to reevaluate your life. i dealt with heavy selfharm razor blades and that gel accid cleaner normal people use for toiletts and pipes. took me nearly 3 years for it to stop calling me when i was down. i tried cocain once and maybe it wasnt the best coke but it didnt beat self harm in terms of a rush. i cut down badum ts on all habits and now i drink a beer with lemonade from time to time or smoke a joint. i go boxing in my house with gloves and a bag when i get anxious or sometimes just bandage up my hands and punch a wooden beam to harden my hands. i try to keep it at a healthy level tho and dont ruin myselfe with my copeing mechanisms. my knuckles are calcified,the bone is stronger and neve ends in the skin are deaded deadened? idk and currently i am conditioning my elbows and shins since i didnt condition my elbows at all kickboxing and taekwondo dont really use them so much and the harder your shins are the more you can throw those roundhouses without beeing afraid you break them. its still self harming kinda but productive and controlled. at least thats my excuse</data>

  <data key="d1">this will get confusing because i replied to my selfe but i wanted to keep the flow of the conversation going so i apologise beforhand. most of the time or most of my life i could have been hospitalised every day because how i think about death and killing myselfe but since i have a bachelors worth of knowledge but not the paper so still not an expert i can score a pretty average medium depression on tests. enough to make them realise but not enough to lock me away. i know what their questions aim at because i also took exams in diagnostic, child psychology, economic psychology, emergency psychilogy, clinical psy, advanced statistics, bio psyc and so on and so forth so i know both sides of the couch so to say. i like to think i would have become a decent therapist. you have to make an additional 4 years learning period where you get therapy and evaluation yourselfe healthcare wouldnt have payed for it even tho i am clinically chronically depressed with a chance of a wooping 35 of ever getting better but as mentioned you need to pay for it yourselfe so its baisically beeing a dirt poor student for another 4 years... they are talking about changing that now but if you studying psychology you would still only be a psychological psychotherapist and need to have studied medicine to prescribe drugs for example. sicne the best therapy is always a dualisty of changing cognitions the patterns of thinking and the chemistry of your brain anti depressants anti psychotics neurolepticas etc etc you will still have to check back with an actuall psychologist. weird system since psychotherapists that went through therapy in the framework of their psychological psychotherapist education arguably sometimes make better therapists then psychologists that have no practical experience what so ever. meh... i do regret not finshing it but there is to much stuff i regret allready so i shouldnt add more to the pile,i guess.</data>

  <data key="d1">another thing we have in common. i used to do kung fu not too long ago so i had about 5 years of experience in it. that also helped me manage stress, so i can understand how you feel about kickboxingtaekwondo d. but at the moment i am way more concentrated on music. listening and playing music helps me through the day to a certain degree. it is great what hobbies like sports and music can do to help you. i guess that might be a coping mechanism for both of us.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes i have been home for 1.5 hours. sorry forgot to mention that when i said all clear. anyway, honestly i think rocksmith is way cooler, since you can actually play a real guitar and not that fake plastic thing. now if only i knew how to play the guitar d but ill stick to the piano in the meantime. and technically you can play most instruments with a keyboard even if they sound bad comparatively. its the versatility i most enjoy and the fact that you can play virtually any genre on it. but you cant deny how influencal guitars have been especially in the metalrock industry.</data>

  <data key="d1">im sorry friend, i wish i knew what would be the thing you could do to change things. unfortunately it tends to be a mixture of stuff which helps a person through tough times. im here if you want to chat? or keep you on track if you have a plan forwards from here. sometimes we need to do the healthy thing even when we dont want to or feel like shit to give us a chance to start feeling better in the future. its like physio. it sucks. your muscle aches all the time, it hurts during your exercises and it hurts after. but after a few months youre stronger and more capable.</data>

  <data key="d1">lockdown can be wearing on people. try and keep yourself occupied. maybe look up things that interest you, or try learning a new skill or do some creative, or join a community you didn't feel you have time for. even if you are stuck inside the internet gives you a lot of different options. some people hate quarantine but i love it. more chance to reddit, write , play games and look up stuff i never had the chance to before. and going for walks our country allow us to exercise once a day and if you don't blatantly abuse it's not hard to get out a 2nd or 3rd feels better than ever. it's all about how you approach it and what you do with it</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah of course you love it thats why youre suggesting all this bullshit advice. you dont understand the struggle at all and you think looking up a new hobby is going to work. just because everyone is affected doesnt make me any less of a victim. i had a life. i had everything going for me and its all gone. you dont care because youre just a 16 year old memelord who drinks mountain dew and plays call of duty or minecraft with your crappy discord friends. your username thistowillpass is such an insult to suicidal people everywhere its not even funny. why dont i take away all your reddit and walks and see how long you last. itll pass right? its no big deal right? just get in a community face ass what the fuck do you mean some people hate the quarantine? nobody likes the quarantine!! some people like you might see it as an extra 3 months of summer vacation but i see it as another attempt at being absolutely miserable. youre probably not even 16. youre younger that that and dont understand how important a flow of money is to some people you probably didnt even read my post. you saw i hate quarantine and came up with that stupid advice pulled out of your ass. you piss me off so much i could go at this all day but id rather not waste any more of my time with your kind ever again 2 days little fuckwit 2 days may 1st i already set up everything i need to kill myself now i just have to wait for the right time</data>

  <data key="d1">you know, it's a very good question. thought provoking. i sat down to try to gather my thoughts on this now. well mate i've been on both sides of the fence, in my life there was times of great suffering but also great bliss as well. honestly, when the suffering reaches such a height, it really doesn't seem worth it. it's like you lose the will to live, and start to wonder why i keep doing this, what's the point, right? we've all been there. when i was really enjoying things though, and i mean honestly enjoying, not lying to myself about it or anything, well then i would start to wonder why i ever wanted to kill myself. it's really such a strange thing, how the thought processes can change completely depending on the mood. so when i was in the valley it really didn't seem worth it, but when i reached the peak oh boy it was a different story. but i still can't answer this question i think, is life worth the pain? i've really given it a lot of thought but can't find a clear answer to it. maybe both answers are true, depending on the perspective and the person. i will say this though, i walked around for years trying to get better and doing all the things i was supposed to do, the thing is, i was not enjoying anything at all. turns out, if there's stuff in the subconscious bothering you, like what happened earlier in your life, you just carry that with you wherever you go and it's kind of running in the background spoiling everything you do and taking all the enjoyment out of it. i don't know if i explained that well, what i mean is, the traumatic events in our lives accumulate, and after it reaches a certain threshold, it just ruins everything from then on. you might not think about those events consciously even, but in the background they take away our ability to enjoy things well, that we used to enjoy. so identifying and coming to terms with those traumatic events, the best i can of course, was the tipping point for me personally. it didn't make me normal suddenly or anything, but man at least i could breathe a little. those are my thoughts on it mate, take care of yourself and of course you can always talk to me whenever you want.</data>

  <data key="d1">we can't always be what are parents want us to be, and that can cause fricition on both ends, but all you can do is focus on trying to be the kind of person you want to be, and pursuing the things that matter to and hoping your parents can come around. i'm also not the child my parents wanted, and its caused a lot of pain, but i've made peace with that. if you pursue the right things, you can still find happiness</data>

  <data key="d1">the thing is homie, you do love your children. you might reassure me you don't, but you are judging yourself by how good of a father you are being right now. i've met some deadbeat motherfuckers who wouldn't give a single fuck if their kids were dead or alive. fuck, there are some twisted motherfuckers who keep them in a basement and rape them every night. now those motherfuckers really don't love their children, they only love their twisted fucking selves. there are monsters out there, but you aren't one of them. the fact that you are honorable enough to fight the demons living inside you rent free, means you are actually a noble hero. so before you do anything, take yourself somewhere quiet. don't bring pills or a gun, but rather take something to eat and drink. maybe a nice sandwich and some wine, or takeout from your favorite fast food place. sit down by yourself, and have a meal with your demons. of course you are the only one who will actually eat, but imagine your thoughts embodied next to you and let your demons tell you what they've been meaning to tell you. they'll probably go and say shit like ah you piece of crap, you don't deserve to be alive, you don't love anyone, not even yourself but then look at the little motherfuckers. who are them? do they look like someone? where do they came from? is any of what they are saying true, or were they placed in your head by some little prick? truth is, the thoughts are not yours. don't trust them. they have been living rent free because you have been to scared to tell them to go fuck themselves somewhere else. it's time to be the landlord and go tell peter parker rent is due. i don't care if you are spiderman or that you're infected with an alien symbiote suit, rent is rent and nobody is living in my house without adding something of value, much less if they are trying to destroy my precious building apartments. nah, fuck you. pay rent or get the fuck out. the reference is from spiderman 3</data>

  <data key="d1">you are not listening. you are a good person. it wasn't a question. bad people don't give a fuck if they diserve to be here or not. they rape and take what they want. you do care about your children, so much so that you believe they're better off without you on this earth because you aren't a good person, but the truth is the complete opposite. you are a good person as long as you stay alive fighting to be a better man. you only become a bad, selfish person the moment you pull the trigger, but every instant prior to that you are still a good person. and again, you didn't listen. i'm not a good person, says who? who? me, i say i'm not a good person who the fuck are you? are you your thoughts? spoiler alert no. and if you were, then every thought would arise isolated deep within you, but the truth is your thoughts don't, they are born from what other people have told you. someone told you that. and now there is a motherfucker demon who is the personification of that thought not paying rent while letting you know you are not a good person. he's been living so long with you can't differentiate him from yourself. fuck him bro. really listen to me and take your demon out on a date somewhere you can be alone. tell him he can't live with you anymore. rent is rent homie. pay up.</data>

  <data key="d1">of course, everything is temporary and that is a fact you never have to forget. what makes me feel sad is that the only thing that drags me down is people! i want to live surrounded by animals. it's like im feeling my life is amazing in terms of where i am now, but that constant harassment, god it makes you feel like shit in the long run. i'm tired of fighting against toxicity, my priority is to remove every toxic people from my every day basis, dont give a fuck if it's family, friends, coworkers or even clients. i'm trying to find peace in my mind, because i got no peace,either there is someone being toxic or my own overthinking creates toxic people.</data>

  <data key="d1">is there something that you would like to major in ? depending on your major you probably wouldnt have to take a speech class. could always do some online classes to, if you arent fully ready to take in person class work. i used to have really bad social anxiety and i sometimes still struggle with it. but things that have helped me is that, i have to constantly remind myself that no one is really paying attention as much as we think they are. a lot of people are oblivious to so many things. i think what has also helped my social anxiety is that ive found my niche in life which has made me a little more confident in myself to do things. i think what helps to, is that in college ppl usually lose that whole teenager mentality of making fun of people. people are a lot more grown up and mature and are usually open and pretty accepting to lots of ppl. i hope one day you are able to be more confident with yourself and live the life you want.</data>

  <data key="d1">you have to understand it is their choice to put their faith in you. you might think you or something else influenced them into putting resources on you, but ultimately, everything is the own person's fault. also, nobody can ask of you to succeed because it's impossible to know what will be of the future. all they can ask is that you do your best which i'm sure you are. it's very hard, but you are. i hope you can see how strong you are everyday</data>

  <data key="d1">i had dreams that ruined my sleep growing up. lucid dreaming helped alot. there is plenty of literature on it. it's really not that hard, it essentially boils town to telling yourself that you are going to be able to do what you want in your dream before sleep. then during sleep you tell yourself that you are dreaming. you can then either wake yourself up when things start to get sketchy. or as you practice more you will be able to do more and more. from running or flying away with super human speed, to even like matrix style using a gun or knife to stop whatevers after you. theres ppl that can litterally create any dream but idk that was too hard sometimes the dream is just fucked and all you can do is wake urself up tho. i haven't done it in a while cause no more nightmares but give it some practice and youd get it down in no time i think.</data>

  <data key="d1">who knows if you might read this, but i think it would be nice to know that you did. i hear a lot about people coming back through meditation, really simple actually. there are a couple good guides on youtube but really all you need is a quiet spot to sit down and cross your legs and just focus on the inhale and exhale of your breath. 1020 minutes every day or longer if you need to clear your head a bit more, use a timer and just don't think about anything other than your breathing. it really helps clear your mind and balance your emotions. maybe one day i'll help someone, maybe one day i'll be seen. i always leave these comments but who knows.</data>

  <data key="d1">you must convince yourself fully that anything you see in your sleep paralysis, no matter how scary it is, is not real. you have power over these demons you see and you don't have to be scared as they cannot do anything but scare you, although that may be difficult to tell yourself so. you can try work yourself into it by sitting alone in the dark at night to condition yourself, or so i've tried and i seem to be more comfortable in the dark now. it's easier if you don't think about what might be in the darkness, because your imagination will take advantage of it.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, well done on having the courage to open up about this, i can understand why it's not fun speaking to strangers about this kind of stuff i'm the same. about your mum, lockdown is very stressful for everyone and it's easy for us to fall back into bad habits. i myself have fallen back into bad habits like eating too much. what's even worse is that smoking is addictive and stressrelieving, so forgive your mum lol. it's a tough situation and it's not just her that has fallen back into old habits, i'm sure she will quit once again when there's a little less stress around. as for wanting to end it all, i think a lot of us can relate. the way you're feeling isn't unusual but at the same time it isn't the healthiest. how old is your sister? if she's older, would you feel comfortable talking to her about how you're feeling? please remember that a lot of people care about you deeply, and that they are there for you no matter how you're feeling. almost everyone is finding it hard to see the bright side of life right now, but hopefully when lockdown is over you'll be able to meet up with your friends again and be in a happier place than you are now</data>

  <data key="d1">hi, its really good to open up about this even if its on here. the first step is to be honest about your feelings. when i was your age i used to bottle up a lot of emotions which has had a lot of negative effects for me now. believe me, if you feel down, your real friends will want to listen. i know at your age other kids may not be emotionally mature to understand your feelings, however, you can always talk to a guidance counsellor from school try and contact them and see if they can connect you to one over the phone seek help with a therapist. if you google it you can find some that you can even speak to over the phone. here is the samaritans hotline 116 123 , someone is always there to talk to. youre only 12 and have your whole life in front of you and you dont want to spend them being down or thinking your life is worthless. quarantine is honestly so bad right now for many peoples mental health, even adults like me. try and find a hobby that makes you happy. read if you like, play games, tv shows, ride a bike, draw etc. it breaks my heart for someone your age to be depressed. i understand sometimes it can feel like your sinking, but try and stay above the feelings. depression can make our view of the world and ourself way more negative than it actually is. when you feel yourself sinking in, try and force yourself to say positive things about yourself and life and remind yourself that you are bigger than depression. for some reason negative thoughts are easier to take over our mind over positive thoughts do you need to train your mind to think positive. it wont happen overnight but it will get better. also if you are religious, then pray, watch services onlineyoutube. i always feel way better when communicating with god, however i know its not for everyone. remember that you are special and your life is worth living. you might not see your value but there are definitely people that do, even if you dont know it</data>

  <data key="d1">hey man, you're in a really shiy place now and i'm really sorry for you but, unfortunately, nothing will make the pain go away except for time. the pain you feel is like an inverse reflection of the love you had for your father. as much as you cared for him is the pain you feel due to his loss. no person can heal this but time heals all wounds. your father wouldn't want to be the cause of death of the he loved. he wouldn't want you to give up due to the pain. it's ok to hurt. it's ok to cry. you're human, not a machine. you're grieving. with time you'll get better at handling these feelings but, for now, take heart in the fact that what you're feeling is fine and expected and things will get better.</data>

  <data key="d1">block that voice out. tell yourself i am who i am, and nothing can change me. that voice is a liar. it lies because it wants to drag you down. you want to be happy right? think positively, do things that make you feel better about yourself. making people smile is my favourite way to combat my demon, maybe you should try it too. nevertheless, i'm here for you. i'm not a counsellor or a therapist but i want to see you realising that life is worth living</data>

  <data key="d1">hi internet friend. youre not a burden on those around you, even if you believe differently. it sucks that youre experiencing heartbreak. ive had my fair share and one in particular left me flailing for three years. but you know what, it did get better. im better for it i know, cliche but i wouldnt have found my partner who i absolutely adore and he adores me. while you may not be experiencing joy now, it doesnt mean youll always feel this way. life can be really hard at times, but those hard times dont last forever. reach out to your friends, family, or a support worker and let them know how you feel. see if they cant help. sometimes all it takes to get some happiness back is to have someone checking in and shooting the breeze with you. keep holding on. you have so much ahead of you.</data>

  <data key="d1">i appreciate your words, honestly. i wouldnt be here if i didnt. and im not intentionally trying to downplay or deny anything you say, but like any other person at the bottom of the barrel, i just cant see the light everyone expects the sad person to see. i thought i had a lot ahead of me, i thought i would get over it, i thought a lot of things, but i just want to rest now. i dont know how people do it but i... i cant... i dont see it... i mean, when i phrase it a different way it doesn't seem so bad? what's so wrong with going to see my dad? plus the only people that ive felt have been honest with me were the people that told me i was somewhat burdening them in real life... i didnt know it wasnt common for people to say that theyre a burden on you until i told a friend of mine about it... maybe because of my mood, i make my life sound worse than what it is, but i mean, like i said, what's so wrong with going to see my dad? that sounds better than the sword? makes it sound.. normal...</data>

  <data key="d1">might be time to find new friends. i went through a pretty shit period. id get up, go through the motions and just look forward to going to bed. i always had an exit plan but id just try to get through the day. things changed for me recently and i guess it was worth the weight. if you told me things would change and id be glad i held on, id have rolled my eyes internally and not have believed it. but they did get better. i drove past an old workplace today where every day i wanted to leave and undertake my exit plan. i drove past and couldnt believe how low i felt when working there. then i felt happy that i made it out the other side.</data>

  <data key="d1">im deeply sorry for the passing of your friend. you are doing what i would do if it were my sister, being there to talk gives her a safe place to go when shes having those bad feelings, therapy might not be for everyone but i just wanted to suggest maybe changing therapists? does she like the one she has? just a thought, maybe a different one would have a better technique that she would relate more withif that makes any sense. i didnt hate my therapist but i felt disconnected from them so i did switch and now i feel like my current therapist understands me, cares for me and she has given me so many tips or tricks on what i can do when im feeling any triggers. not sure if this helps but i thought maybe it was worth saying. i hope your sister the best</data>

  <data key="d1">it's honestly pretty cool people still 'board, it's a neat skill and lots of fun. it sucks you had a bad experience with it, but you can't let that keep you down, like a scuffed knee or a twisted ankle it's a lesson learned and you just need to give it time to heal, and that applies to your mental state too. it's alright to cry and let that negativity in, but only up to a point, you've gotta' come out the other side stronger than you were before, and given what you say about your mom, you've gotta' be pretty hardy to have made it through that, it's tough and unfair, but you have to remember that none of that is your fault. i hope you can get to boarding again soon, op.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah it's funny. i told a girl i've had a crush on for 8 years that i loved her 2 weeks ago. the weeks leading up to that, i could wake up at 6am and do 12 hours of nonstop productive work and still had energy. like, i would wake up, jog, buy food at the grocery store, shower, study for school, complete an assignment, workout, cook, etc effortlessly. i was at the happiest i'd ever been, and i felt braver. so, as i sat next to her in the locker room i finally managed to have the balls to tell her. she just stood there, said she was shocked and that her mind was blank. she only answered a few hours later on facebook since she's quite introverted, but i could see it in her eyes. she would never love me. now i can hardly do anything useful. i've come to realize that the only thing that made me happy and made my life worth living was seeing her and talking with her, and making her laugh. i've lost interest in anything and everything, and i don't even know who i am anymore. i went from the top of the world to buying a rope and a bench. i really put myself in a trap without realizing it. i wanted to be reasonable though, so i gave myself one month before committing to my decision. 2 weeks left. life is funny.</data>

  <data key="d1">who said i didnt try? tried multiple things in multiple levels, from professional to personal. went out of my comfort zone it has this name for a reason to try something different to achieve happiness. as i said, i feel like in a hamster wheel, everything i try, everything i do is like a sprint in hope of breaking the wheel and move forward, but in the end im in the same wheel. maybe looks nicer or is a bit beaten, maybe someone move the cage, but im exhausted after the sprint and running in hamster wheel non stop. seriously, for a moment, some time ago i thought i had the recipe for happiness, not for the whole void in my soul, but i thought it would fill an important part, it failed. at least i thought it could help me in the process and serve at least as a bridge, but recent events said nope, youre fucked here. i think its just a bad moment and in the future i would have a better opportunities... to be in a nicer looking hamster wheel with a better cage. it is weird? im just want to be happy, cause being a gear in a machine just for being a gear doesnt make sense to me. yes, i can be a gear, i dont care being a gear, fuck, ill be your best gear, but please, allow me to be happy, give me a motivation, a finality, something that after being fucked everyday i had at least the sense or the illusion of being happy. cause, if im not happy, what am i? a piece a meat with a brain that can do things? not extraordinary things, just things. and if im just a piece of meat that can do things, not normal things but really replaceable in my field, so why i should do my usual meat thing hamster whee running thing if i do no get anything in compensation that can bring me happiness or the illusion of it. recently my wheel turning realised me that in the grand medium or at least small scheme of things i can do people happy. may be sound egotistical, fuck, i dont care of it is egotistical, but helping someones life in what way benefits me? also my work wasnt crucial his life would be ok before my intervention, i just did the boring part ok, technically my work helped on it, but i was by no mean essential, anybody could do it am i an idiot? should be a lemming and just be ok that my mission is to stop other lemmings and allow them go the other direction to salvation? im just and idiots for wanting to be happy? is happiness reserved just for an elite and im a nail sticking out? im just naive for believing that almost everyone else is happy and i should be able to? should i stick to my place of normal unhappy gear cause the machine demands it? ps not an english speaker, using autocorrect and also maybe the alcohol hit hard at half while writing the post, so.... sorry for inconsistencies, misspellings, nonsense and all the shit ps2 oh fuck, thought that gin would be easier on me than vodka, oh boy, i was wrong. ps3 maybe was the dosage, i think i drank too much.... yay happy suicidal intent monthniversary</data>

  <data key="d1">there's probably some career out there that's good for me. that's what i was in the hopes of but in the backward country i live in and the absolutely despondent situation of the world... i don't want to and no i'm not referring to the pandemic. it masks much greater issues and will push them to the sidelines for so much more time and i just can't live here anymore.</data>

  <data key="d1">your feelings are completely valid, the fast world of media and the overwhelmingly positive messages from friends on social media make it seem like we are the ass holes for not meeting those expectations. it feelings like a minor dystopia non? after reading though your post, i get the sense you are an intelligent individual so i will lay, in my opinion, the facts down. life only has the meaning you give it. if you believe you should cure cancer on tuesday, aids on wednesday, and fuck it we will put covid on the schedule for thursday. you are going to be down when that doesn't happen. if you determine that by next week you will start learning guitar, then all you have to do is touch a guitar in that week and you will be successful. your life is made up of your goals, don't let the world dictate your lifebe who you want to be. if you want to aim for the stars then do it! i get the sense you could totally make it happen, just break it up into small success metrics that you can achieve over time. rome was not built in a day. edit also, screw those people saying you are attention seeking, your feelings are valid</data>

  <data key="d1">so you bought everything yourself, which means you didnt take money but earned it, my friend thats not privilege, thats hard work, if your getting straight as in maths and english then that means you have not only a good revision ability but also natural talent, theres no pseudosmarts to that, your a talented kid by the sounds of it. you down play yourself, you have big achievements and excellent smarts and u earned all of that by yourself? how can that be spoilt or ungrateful or a cowardice. the fact you earned enough to buy and maintain equipment for ur skills u wanted to develop shows strength not cowardice, you need to understand that you have a natural gift and you earned everything. your parents could be more understanding of your condition, you cant help the temper tantrums, you should explain this to them after every single time so it sinks into them, you may be in a privileged position but anyone can be affected by depression and suicidal thoughts and mental health issues so just because u dont have to worry about the food on ur plate doesnt mean that ur mental health care should be any different to a working class person. the only way ur a trashy human being is completely relying upon other people and manipulating and deceiving and lying and taking what they earned away and being an asshole and unappreciative and ignorant, you dont seem like a single one to those, you just seem like a kid who worries hes not enough, theres nothing wrong with that. good luck friend</data>

  <data key="d1">i cant say i bought everything myself, but i bought most of the equipment except for the pc. im talking like, a really good pc. i feel spoilt because, well, ive grown up with a certain mindset youre not studying for anyone else, youre studying for yourself and i dont expect to be rewarded just because i got good grades, and so, i believe its a formality at this point. i believe im spoilt because i have the resources to do a lot and most of my days are spent trying and failing. im spoilt because even if my parents are really strict, i know they love and for them, its hard to understand what a mental condition is because when they were little, they couldnt stop to think about. they were dirt poor. ive explained to them that i dont like feeling this way but my brother mocks me off saying i probably am alone because no girl notices me, my mother tries her hardest but we fall back into a loop where she just gives up and starts ignoring me because i can get really intense with my selfloathing, and my father doesnt believe in psychology psychiatry. while i do think i played a part in my abilities and skills, i think that part goes for the most part at 10 because i wouldnt know english if i didnt have access to youtube im selftaught for the most part and or go to a private elementary. i wouldnt have analytical skills if my father didnt teach me.</data>

  <data key="d1">if you can, reach out to a professional. assuming you haven't yet, means you also haven't exhausted all your options. it's true. your life really wasn't pretty. there's still a slim chance that you can make it though. x200b to make an analogy, your house is on fire right now. you've tried everything by yourself, you went with your bucket of water and poured and poured. but that's not gonna cut something as big as this. if you were really in that situation, you wouldn't think twice about calling the firefighters. you wouldn't give a damn if they charged you, you wouldn't give a damn about anything else other than your house cause that's all you have right now. and who knows, the flames might have gone on for long enough that all you'll have left by the end is a pile of ashes. or they just won't be able to stop the flames at all. but it's also a possibility that they can, through various methods. you'll never know until you try. and after you've tried everything, and nothing seems to help, you can come back here.</data>

  <data key="d1">i was a reckless carefree teenager and i fucked up pretty bad. i got let off easy and decided to turn my life around. part of doing so was pushing away all the bad people i had in my life mainly friends and this has caused me much pain. so i decided to have no emotion basically but this backfired and i ended up pushing away everyone close to me and i am left all alone with a shit ton of emotion inside thats been building up. i tried to turn my life around, and it worked kind of because i am no longer doing bad things but i am not doing good things either. this has cause me to have a lot of free time and a lot of time to think about things. i have nothing going for me. at least when i was doing all this stupid stuff, i was fearless and carefree. now i am the opposite. i worry way too much about everything and overthink everything and all i do is watch tv and play video games to numb the pain. i have not improved the world we live in therefore i question my value.</data>

  <data key="d1">it sounds like you have a very low selfesteem. you think you're useless and have no value to the world. i would look to reframe this thought of yours, if you'd please. are you really without value and purpose if you've already shown so much ability, strength and determination? you were able to push away toxic people! that's a huge thing that so many people aren't able to do! you clearly have intelligence that can be put towards something that can improve the world! also, you don't have to be a genius to change the world for good, did you know? you need only do the smallest things. helping an old lady cross the street, feeding the stray cat some milk or even just planting some flowers outside for the bees to pollinate is a wonderful thing. it might not be a brand new invention or a cure for cancer, but in my opinion, the little things are just as important it takes big gears and little gears to make a clock tick! you can do your part and work your way up!</data>

  <data key="d1">keep reminding them of how long they actually fought and survived and how they have come so far. if they have survived for so long, remind them they just need to hold on just for a little more time. if they dont wanna talk, dont talk just be present on the call. put the person's pain first. dont use the word selfish coz calling them selfish dosen't rly help coz in every attempt i have had atleast like 5 ppl tell me that i was selfish and it just further makes u beat urself up even more. if they are in a state of mind to listen to someone talk, mention all the happy moments that u both shared or they had and how he would have never experienced it if he had died by suicide. obviously, let them know again of all the people who love this person. and also just tell them to exist. don't tell them to do things that take a lot of effort especially when u are suicidal. when u are suicidal trying to stay alive is so difficult and it almost seems impossible to try and do anything else. so just tell them to hang on and just hold on. and keep reminding them there are so many ppl who care and talk about all the little things and big things in how much u care about him.</data>

  <data key="d1">it could help to hear it from an outside perspective. if he doesn't like the idea of in person therapy, you could also let him know that it's possible to have online sessions. especially at this time with covid still being a prominent part of our lives. i might even suggest couples therapy for the two of them, at least to start out. that's how i convinced my fiance to start therapy and now he's very happy with it. i really hope you find a way to help him. you and your husband sound like very good friends and he is lucky to have you.</data>

  <data key="d1">that is a valid concern. perhaps try to take it slow to not overwhelm him. tell them both that you care and are really worried about their well being. i would also be concerned as to how the wife might react because it could trigger him. hopefully if you take these into consideration you can find a way to show that you only care and aren't forcing him into anything.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think the fact that you are struggling to find the courage to commit suicide shows that deep down inside you don't really want to. remember suicide is a permanent answer to in most cases temporary solutions, not to mention the psychological harm it imposes to the people who surround you. if you can't find the courage to do it, it's probably because you don't want to see the end and you want to know what tomorrow holds. i would stick with it dude, and keep going. suicide is never the answer.</data>

  <data key="d1">the fact that the chance of a failed attempt is more of a deterrent than the fact that your life will end and everything will be gone is concerning. i can tell you from personal experience that suicide as an easy way out never helps anyone. i can tell you for a fact you family, friends, close ones, will all be devastated and sometimes suicide can impose psychological harm on anyone around you, especially parents. i wouldn't do it man. i would really highly recommend talking to someone you love about these thoughts and feelings.</data>

  <data key="d1">what she said was wrong. i understand where she is coming from, but it doesnt make it any more right. i can also see your point of view. i can see how you believe youre going to make it easier for others if you go through this. and im sorry you feel that way. i really am. i know what its like to feel helpless. to feel overwhelmed. but i still believe you can have a wonderful life op. i do. im sorry if it makes you feel as if the way youre feeling right now doesnt matter, because it absolutely does. everything you feel is valid. youre not less of a person for feeling this way.</data>

  <data key="d1">i just got nothing going for me, plain and simple. i screw up everything i do, no matter the effort i shove into it. i have really no friends, and the ones i do, well... i'm that one 'friend' everyone ditches and wipes their memories clean about. i'm likely on the spectrum, and my parents are emotionally neglectful, for the most part. there's so much i yearn to say, but cannot or have trouble fabricating into words. i'm just.. nothing special, honestly. no one has ever shown true, genuine interest in me. i possess zero true talent nor charisma. living is painful, and everyday i wake up closer to kicking the bucket. i'm graduating high school soon im a senior 17f and have been planning to commit suicide on my graduation day. i know no one would be hurt or cared. heck, no one would probably bother attending my funeral. i'll be left to rot underground with the worms feasting on my ugly corpse.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm sorry that you feel that you having nothing valuable. i must disagree, though, as i feel differently. you're young enough that you have yet much to give to the world. even simple activities such as volunteer work and the like would prove that you have a positive effect in the world. you're surely capable of that. your post is rather clear, you didn't screw that up. emotional neglect is tough, it actually goes hand in hand with making you lonely. it makes you to afraid to open up to actually maintain a friendship. the lack of friendships further reinforces the cycle. there are ways to improve and get better from this situation. they do take some time and effort, though, but luckily, you have plenty of that to spare as you're 17. finally, people would care if you died. it is likely that no one knows what's going on in your head now. people would definitely attend your funeral. don't do it, though. things, with work, can definitely get better.</data>

  <data key="d1">thanks for the advice and i hope that what you say is true. my world is so dark and foggy right now that it just hurts to keep going or stay positive. an issue i struggle with is that i never, ever feel in place, or accepted, or welcomed. i wasted majority of my past high school years stuck in this depression and maintaining average grades. the clubs i joined made me feel unwanted so i stopped participating. i lived far from my school and didn't have a car at the time weird district set up and buses weren't always available, so i found it hard to make it to certain events. i feel like a black sheep, like i wasn't meant to be born on this planet. i've had 2 attempts already, and i'm hoping it does get better. time is flying by so quick.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm sorry to hear that. university will likely be easier as you'll live near everyone else and it's easier to find people who share common interests. the feeling unwelcome is a telling sign of emotional neglect, unfortunately i really know what you mean. there are way to deal with it, though they all take time and effort. it's much harder to improve alone than with a therapist. would you be able to get one, just to get you started? if you find one you're comfortable opening up to they can really help. if not, i can give you pointers for starters.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's hard getting a therapist or medication at the moment due to my parents. they don't believe in medication, mental illness, none of that stuff. they believe therapy is fake and just a money scheme. i'm not joking... when i tried committing suicide those two other times they literally just scolded me for being so stupid and ungrateful. once my school guidance counselor called them because of my behavior and what do you know they yelled at me again. they never have ever taken me seriously, only another reason to end it all. university? if i'm ever accepted.</data>

  <data key="d1">what failures of parents! you don't deserve this at all. no wonder your self esteem is in the toilet. the people who were supposed to care about you apparently didn't. they completely failed at parenting. look, in one year you can escape all of this, apply to schools, a state school will help with affordability. worst case, moneywise, with a state school, it's possible to work your way through college. you'll live on campus away from these people. that is a benefit that shouldn't be underrated. it'll help you decompress from all the crap you've been through. you may want to tell your guidance counselor what you're telling me. you should let him know that your parents berate you for being suicidal. he may be able to help you find therapy options. worst case, vent to us here. we're here to listen. i'm sorry you're going through this. you didn't deserve this.</data>

  <data key="d1">sorry all those things happened to you man. i too was bullied very badly growing up.im almost 16 btw kids would just say really nasty things to me like your life is so pointless and worthless and man youre so weird and dumb nobody wants to be friends with you. some would even threaten to physically abuse me, and all of those things definitely drove me towards having a suicidal mindset. ive attempted to off myself 6 times first time being when i was 12 and last one being about a month ago. so yeah i definitely know what its like to endure years of severe bullying plus having no friends by your side, its one of the most painful and traumatic experiences for any kid who went through all of that</data>

  <data key="d1">do i regret attempting suicide? kind of. i dont regret it too much since almost nobody knows about it and that i might actually go through with it when im older, but at the same time i would probably leave everyone in a huge shock since they didnt know i was suffering. ive been suffering in silence for years and i dont know when or who to ask for help. i seriously need help</data>

  <data key="d1">it's not selfish. you want to stop the pain, and really anybody would in your shoes as well but suicide really isn't the answer. look, we have the same experience. i lost everything after my exit attempt. it's a dark and terrible path but fuck those people. weakwilled, excusefilled, fairweather friends. you deserve better people to care about you and love you. maybe you don't feel that way but you do deserve good things. get help, and move away from the memory, even if it's by the smallest steps. now, i don't know you, so it's hard to give concrete advice, but if you need to spill your worries, i'm here to listen and i will try my best to help you.</data>

  <data key="d1">selfishly? how in the fuck are you selfish for wanting to end your own suffering? most people in the world couldnt take what youve gone through. and the fact that you are still are here even with such suffering and pain, shows how strong you really fucking are. the people who wouldnt give you support are vile, they are scum. if they cant support someone they know on a personal level or not, with a single word or sentence. dont deserve to even be in your memory or thoughts because you deserve better then that.</data>

  <data key="d1">this is exactly what i said to the woman on the hotline except her platitude was that everything happens for a reason. and to that i asked then why do children in their teens shoot themselves or hang themselves? was it because they didnt agree with god's reasoning? and i didnt pose it to make an argument because there is no arguing with christian logic. she just changed the subject to being positive to which i asked if she had ever heard of toxic positivity, to which she responded that evil lives in our heads, to which i asked if evil were like a virus and she exclaimed yes! yes! which is when i said that if a virus is within you, invading your cells and taxing your system, is it really a good idea to wall something like that off in your conscious mind, certainly because you cant wall it off in your body because eventually, it's going to spread everywhere and you could enter a terminal state regardless of your current height of positivity. then she talked about forgiveness, which is some passive horseshit that no one needs to hear when they're angry enough to kill themselves.</data>

  <data key="d1">you cant fight it. you have to accept it. what you resist shall persist. when you start accept it, and not being afraid of it anymore, suddenly it starts to lose its grip. its so paradoxical and counterintuitive, but i swear it fucking works. i had to literally accept that i had no hope for me to actually get any relief. ah, so insane how it works...</data>

  <data key="d1">what it comes down to is whether or not you feel you deserve to live or not. who is telling you beside yourself that you dont deserve to live? yes, the feeling can be so strong and overpowering that it feels like it is a part of you. but its just a mad thought, i wantdeserve to die! but you have the ability to decide whether you want to latch onto that feeling or not. meditation is huge for that. think of it this way, if you knew that you were truly a worthy individual, and you felt like you deserve to die, you would immediately reject that idea and call bs on it. so, trying to fight depression anxiety is useless. instead, focus on building yourself up and believing in your worth. the rest will slowly work itself out over time.</data>

  <data key="d1">go. try it out. be honest, otherwise it doesnt help. a therapist would only do something like that if they really really thought you were at risk. they want to build trust, not ruin it. ive been to a hospital recently, my therapist hasnt threatened involuntary admission yet, even when i tell her very disturbing things lol.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've actually learned to appreciate people with adhd. they've always been incredibly intelligent people in my life. their quirky personalities gave them such huge heart. their tolerance for sadness was extremely high. they were ambitious and driven. sometimes i was even jealous. one of them, i had romantic feelings for. there are also hotlines you can anonymously call, and they're free! some them do have trained and qualified therapists to speak to you, and help you understand the way you're feeling.</data>

  <data key="d1">you dont need to attempt suicide to get the help you need. it sounds like you want help and love your siblings. call your countrystates suicide hotline and ask for help if those close to you arent helping. if i had died when i attempted i wouldnt have been alive to donate a kidney to my little sister and save her life eight years later. over a decade and a half later, im still depressed but im so glad to have had the experiences i have since my attempt. the idea of true happiness and satisfaction with yourself is always going to look better than now when you think about the future, but when you look at the past you will understand you have experienced true happiness even when you werent aware of it. stay safe. there are people who care.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's often the idea that the only way we can get help is if we attempt. to be frank, some mental health professionals don't even care if you did just try to kill yourself, so it's better to get help before that point. my first attempt was a sort of i'll do this and if i fail i'll get help but in retrospect it was kind of an odd line of thinking. i hope you can find a way to get some support. it sounds like you have a lot of love in your heart and are so loved in return.</data>

  <data key="d1">sweetheart, you are worth more than to be tossed aside after 2 years, and the woman who did it to you sounds very cruel considering the circumstances. you are so very young though, and in 10 years you will look back and be so proud of yourself for pulling through and pushing forward. i am not in the best position myself to really say this too much, but please do not let the choices of others define your emotions. i know it's easier said than done, but you can't control what others do. you can just try your best to take care of yourself, to love yourself, because people come and go. and the ones who go, are gone for a reason.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, the beach is wonderful, isn't it? the cool waves, warm sand, and that golden glint that appears when the sun strikes the water just right. you've given yourself less than three months, and in that time, you might go to some memorable places. maybe walk around in a green field, and just enjoy the experience. you might meet some memorable people. when the time comes, would you still go? obligations are overwhelming, and sometimes, life is as well. life comes and goes, passing by like birds flying ahead. what really anchors us is the memories and attachments we hold. you might not always have friends, but you do have memories of them. perhaps you have a picture you hold dear to yourself, or a special memory you can't help but replay over and over again. dreams are impossible, but they lead everyone closer to what's possible. they motivate us, and in time, we feel like we're living a dream. maybe not ours, but it's still a feeling content. being vulnerable is sad, and i can understand that it sucks sometimes, but the comfort that you give when you help someone in their vulnerable moments is a nice feeling. your life does matter. it has all those memories, good or bad. the bad days are horrible, but the good days are even better. you are never obligated to find love. love will come with you if you are ready. if you don't want it, that's fine. you amount to years and months and days and hours and minutes. you amount to memories others cherish. you amount to conversations people will never forget. you amount to the knowledge you've gained, and the kindness you've shared. this might not fully convince you to stay, but i hope it sways your mind a slight bit.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey love, i know the feeling. its awful and it hurts and it feels like itll never end. but take it one step at a time. one minute at a time. one moment at a time. it may feel impossible to make it to the next year, or next month, or next day, but you dont need to worry about that. just worry about now. think about doing something that will make you feel better, however tiny and insignificant. if its getting a hug from someone you love. or blasting the fuck out of your favourite song. or watching something to make the thoughts fade into the background. you can do this. you can survive this moment. you are more resilient than you know</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you so much, sometimes i try and express this to people i know and my bf but he always just tells me that he loves me and that be couldnt do it without me. and it scares me because that doesnt even deter me. i know he would be okay without me, he doesnt mind me going to bed fragile and crying. he wouldnt mind if i was gone forever. everyone would be slightly less burdened really. i guess i have tried finding peace in things like music and things i like like dance but i have no motivation. like its run out. i cant even find it to brush my teeth and my hair in the morning. its getting harder as well. im holding on my for my mums sake. but its getting harder to hold on the more i realise people dont care and that i am so useless in this life. realistically i dont ever think i will do it. only because i know i dont have the guts. ill just live a depressed and sad 95 life and hope one day i go in a freak accident on a motorway, end up as a bunch of flowers with people saying oh dear poor girl thank you for replying</data>

  <data key="d1">i just want you to know that the thoughts of people not minding and everyone being okay if you were gone, that youre just a burden to everyone and theyd be better off without you those thoughts are your depression speaking, and theyre not true, not one bit. you are valuable and wonderful and you. your boyfriend is dating you because he loves you. your family loves you. the cant imagine a world without you in it because it would be like there was a hole in it, something missing, and that something missing is you. no one can replace you, and you add meaning and light to the lives of those who care about you just by existing. as for dealing with the depression, i really recommend seeking professional help, either a therapist or a psychiatrist or both, if thats possible. you dont have to keep pretending youre okay and that everythings fine. its okay to reach out for help when you need it. and therapy and meds can truly make a world of a difference. they make the depression so much more manageable, and sometimes it can feel like its not even there. i really hope things look up for you</data>

  <data key="d1">i know someone would bring that up. all that you have your whole life ahead of you bullshit. just the other day i thought i was 13 , teenage years go by so fucking fast and i just know i won't get even a decent career. in my country you're expected to have a full time job that pays you well and a healthy life with a fucking house at 17. and no i don't live in asia. i'm just really hopeless</data>

  <data key="d1">im 17. trust me, i know how you feel. and yeah, i sometimes find the you have your whole life ahead of you thing weird sometimes . either way, it sounds like youre burntout from too much stress. it happens when we dont take care of ourselves, and inside, we dont agree with the things we're doing. having a full life and house by 17 on your own is impossible. and its honestly ok if you didn t have a boyfriend or weren't someones crush . i never was either. about not having friends, i didnt either when i was 15. most people were super fake around me, although i'm to blame for that. but then i moved and i got a fresh start, a new lease on life. new friends things like that. but i also started to work on myself. i didnt have any marketable hobbies or interests, but i picked some up. x200b also, i get where you're coming from, about dealing with expectations. i wrote my 10th grade exams, passed with distinction. my parents kept telling everyone i failed, just because i didnt pass their expectations. they still say it today. the trick is to set your own standards and reach those. and learn how to not give a fuck, but youve got that down already. and not having goals, well... isnt there something youd like to do apart from going to the afterlife? you know, places youd like to visit, things to eat, stuff like that? wouldn't you like to to get to see more of the world? also, what if you killed yourself? what about your mother? what would happen to her? x200b and you still havent answered me, whats really bothering you?</data>

  <data key="d1">first thing id say is fuck what everyone else wants to do. do what you want to do hopefully its not sucide. i used to feel like that all the time until i had a hobby which was lifted best choice ive ever made. and i agree when someone says you have your who life. its youre life do what you want</data>

  <data key="d1">first off let me say suicide is a long term solution to a short term problem. lighten up on yourself, i read your other post and it sounds like you have a lot to deal with right now. that alongside all those hormonal changes happening and little or no support from your parents can make it seem like life is shit. believe me it only seems like it from where you are at the moment. you have to help yourself a little here and give yourself the opportunity to get better. start small, set yourself some realistic targets to achieve. taking a 30 min walk outside everyday, thats not so hard is it? reward yourself by listening to some music you really love, combine the two. start eating healthy, make it a goal to get the fruit and veg in. its a fact that has a positive effect on your mental health. look for solutions not problems but find small achievable ones, each success you have will help rebuild your confidence. before you know it those things that appeared insurmountable will just be another small problem to be dealt with in the same way you dealt with all the others. and during this, time will pass more quickly, youll get older, wiser and stronger. dont give up on your potential, you are worth more than you currently think. stay healthy and stay safe.</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you for that whole paragraph. it makes me feel less lonely ina way. and i dont really know whats bothering me. i have a good life if i wouldn't have those thoughts. i cant really complain , its all in my head , i just think life is shit for me. i got abused and beaten as a kid maybe thats what fucked me up idk. or maybe because i dont have anyone who loves or care about me other than my mother. or maybe because i fail everything in school or have little to no joy in living or maybe because i have some kind of illness i haven't gone to the doctors yet. i'll try my best to get a decent future for myself thank you</data>

  <data key="d1">salam doost. i have iranian parents too. it can be tough culturally, since our parents can be a bit more into our business, than some of the more western raised families, and the pressure of success and living up to our parents dreams can be a lot other cultures of course have the pressure too. do you remember anything that gave you peace, joy, happiness, wonder, curiosity, beauty, love in your life, ever? whether thats a walk outside for 20 minutes in a park, it can help us feel calmer and more relaxed. i think the pressure is a lot, understandably. if maybe you communicate with your father the stress of school, he may cut some of the hours till at least covid is over. i know if i was your parents, i would rather have the son i love to be alive and more content, rather than to build a new house a bit faster. even if your father or mother is a bit disappointed which they very well may not be, if they listen, it can free up some time for things that help you feel better and less stressed, and you wont feel so overextended. and once covid is over and classesin person work is more common, i promise you, from the bottom of my heart, that youll be able to find friends. if it helps, when i have ever had suicidal thoughts, i realized it meant that i wanted the pain to lessen because i was so overwhelmed for so long, rather than i didnt want to live anymore. our lives are a wonder. as a doctor, you can help so many people, including yourself, to lessen their pain, whether physical or psychological. and im sure you are incredibly bright, since konkoor is not easy, especially as a doctor. i believe in you friend. good days are ahead. 3 this has just been a tough year for all of us, but better days are coming im sure and hopefully the sanctions stop sometime soon, if biden comes up, and there would be less economic pressure on people living in iran trying to make ends meet. wish you the very best. 3</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm an 22yearold iranian girl and i absolutely know your pain brother. the pain is a burden we born with and must carry our whole life. i'm an agnostic but my strictly religious parents force me to wear chador and do all the stuff muslims should do, because what other ppl would say about them if i wouldn't do this stuff? the whole thing is about them, always them, never me. i'm an engineering student and i managed to get into a university that was far from the city my family lives in, so i would see them less often and could have more peace mentally, but because of this covid19 situation they forced us to flee our dorms and now i'm stuck in here with them again. we have an argument almost every day. we even had the same exact argument about cats. i hate it here. i see no future for myself. how the hell could i ever afford to live independently? how the hell could i ever afford to own my place, to not be under their influence? my whole life is dedicated to leaving iran because i know i have no chance for living a normal life here, but i know that my family won't support me by any means. we are not that poor of a family, we are middle class and the money that i need for immigration let's say 40k usd at most, is just about 14 of the value of a flat of the entire building my parents own. but i know for a fact they will never help me, because my dad says we should love our country and islam, this is the best country in the world, usa is doomed to failure, we love our family and can't live without each other, etc. but guess what? i hate every single one of those things. i really wish death may sooner put me out of my misery.</data>

  <data key="d1">hello dadash, life is full of surprises and random. you never know what may happen. humans are good at determining the trend but they can never tell that the trend is always changing. there is happiness to be found in life and you deserve it, and make no mistake, that happiness can be in places you never expect. by stopping life, you will deny yourself the opportunity to be happy. the opportunity to laugh. it's only darkness after that. from a game theory perspective, killing yourself is not rational, there's nothing you can gain. you're a smart guy obviously like me lol and your english is better than 90 of native english speakers. i live in north america, and so should you. you should work your best to go out of iran and believe me it will be hard but you can find happiness. don't deny yourself the possibility of happiness.</data>

  <data key="d1">im going to be honest, i also suffer from time to time, that is life. however, what made me feel better, and makes life worth living is my family, my dogs, and the friends i have made along the way. when you realise your self worth, and that your life is unique and not like anybody else whether thats hobbies, aspirationsdreams, experiences... you want to protect it. you say that you are not living up to your father's expectations, that should not be your focus. coming from someone who has had an abusibe father, it should matter that you are not living up to their 'expectations' it is not their life it is yours. what are your dreamsgoals? what do you want to ve when you grow up?</data>

  <data key="d1">i dont think this is universally true. sometimes things do get better. but, youre right, sometimes they dont. sometimes it takes outside help, like medication or counseling. i know that it cant just be life circumstances, because there are people with hard experiences that are happy, and people who have it all and are not happy. i think it is a combination of life experience, chemical makeup, and attitude. i understand it being frustrating when people say it gets better been there, but just because it hasnt yet doesnt mean that it literally never will. it could get better. i hope it does, for your sake. im sorry people are so dismissive</data>

  <data key="d1">sorry to hear i can relate. its shitty having parents you know you cant talk to. ive never spoke to my parents about my feelings and whilst its something ive simply adapted to since a young age, its still quite sad but ive always said i prefer it this way. thats a brilliant goal youve set yourself though and you shouldnt feel disheartened, these things take time and youre still young. please dont become too reliant on alcohol also, as whilst it may seem its helping, its secretly doing far more damage. i hope things get better for you, and if you ever feel you have no one to talk to, im always here to chat.</data>

  <data key="d1">anytime the moment comes to talk about the things causing me immense emotion distress and dangerous thoughts, i avoid it. it's scary making youraf vulnerable to other people especially when you have a history of being ignore and belittled for feeling hopeless. i'm really sorry you have to deal with this as well. i know that going for alcohol is going to hurt me long term but i get in the mindset of haha i'll prob be dead in a year so who cares</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah i get that entirely avoiding it is just a defensive mechanism i guess and a normal way of coping. its like a massive question that never gets answered and its so frustrating because all you want to do is talk but the mind rejects doing it through fear and uncertainty of whos actually there to listen. i really am sorry you feel like this and i hope youll find your own way of coping and relieving the pain even if its alcohol for now.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know exactly how you're feeling. some days, i just think i want attention and that i'm a fraud pretending to be depressed. other days, i just don't care anymore. but, there's one thing someone on the internet has said that has stuck with me until now. if you're thinking about selfharm or suicide, you're not faking it. i'm not going to say whether suicide is right or wrong or whether i understand your situation, because, i don't. what i will tell you is that, either way, neither is wrong. if you want someone to talk to, i'm always here.</data>

  <data key="d1">as i read the several posts you all have posted on here, im gravely discouraged how my prediction that suicidal thoughts would increase especially during this time. i am human, just like you, and i dont come pretending like i have answers, but i can tell you ive survived several suicide attempts and several losses of life of most of the most important people in my life...including my boyfriend of 4 years and a parent. here are somethings that have helped along the way. it doesnt over night...but the more you try the better your chances are at not only surviving but perhaps looking forward to life. ive been raped by someone i loved, ive been beaten since a young age, ive been manipulated, used, shamed, and shot myself in the foot. the list does go on. 1. people will disappoint you obviously, but there are some people out there maybe you havent met yet who genuinely care about you and your wellbeing. those who have disappointed you, whom you desperately want approval from hurt you. thats normal to feel hurt. but you werent born into your life for someone else. if someone special in your life is worth the sacrifice, then carefully examine the relationship. if youre hurting, and someone uses an automated hollow response that seems to put a lid on your expression of feelings, sometimes it not ill intent, and sometimes depending on a cold response someone has, they arent worth your time. its so easy to lose faith in humanity. but diamonds do exist in the rough. keep looking. 2. its all too familiar to feel so stuck in our little prisons of life, routine, bad habits, bad relationships, just lifestyles that does not hold promise for your peace, happiness and truth. the hardest part is getting started but once you have traction going, it gets easier...we have to give ourselves chances to break out of the simulation. you deserve boundaries no matter your age. why do other people have boundaries but then there are those who feel they dont deserve it? because youre probably too kind to see that even though your heart is huge, you cant put it on your sleeve. its one thing to show respect to people, but true respect is earned. you deserve that. 3. trying something new can be frightening or seem like that sounds lame....but it can be just what you need. if you are anxious easily, its normal yet you must take a leap of faith without impulse. have you made a kite before? look up the steps, give it a try, take your time. have you looked up some nice hiking areas? trying art even if you feel like you suck? even if you feel you fail, you gain. 4. we are all going to die eventually, why not play the game until time runs out? pain is a great defense. i understand pain, almost like torture....but there are ways to escape it. there are things to look forward to. even if they are small. learning the value of the uniqueness of something meaningful to you, and taking time to think about the things you do have that are blessings are easy to take for granted, but its a gift. we arent promised anything in life except one day it will end, but im sure you can think of at least three things that have been good in your life. it may seem like everything blows right now, but its not forever. 5. patience is key. ive spent years feeling like i was spiraling into death. patience is only going to make you stronger which will lead to further success in life. 6. perspective can be shifted, and cognitive healing techniques and how you react is extraordinarily helpful. 7. theres so many types of meditation, even though it seems pointless many times. 8. eating a nourishing meal, or trying new cuisine to cook helps, even with a budget. make it an occasion even if its for yourself to have dinner. no matter your weight, you deserve to nourish your body. salmon has been proven to significantly increase chemicals in the brain that sparks optimism and productivity. 9. seeing a therapist or calling the suicide hotline can seem like youre talking to a robot filled with cliches that are tired like...true love starts with you... or there will be light at the end of the tunnel which is almost insulting. perspective starts with you....and learning what to add and subtract from you life as time goes on helps step by step. not everyone will seem to get in tuned with what you experience, keep the faith. someone may say something you can relate to so well that it will bring clarity in some form or another. hang onto those moments. 10. we are never truly alone as lonely as many of you feel. its a horrible feeling when you dont have someone to tell you how much they admire you, no one whos holding you tight, but if more people knew you im sure many can see the beauty you have and your potential. there is always someone out there willing to be there for you, maybe you need to take the time alone to heal and restore yourself a bit after a good long rest. thats some of what i had to say. i really hope many of you find faith in yourselves and what life could be. you deserve it! im here if you want to vent to someone. youre not weird or weak because you have emotions like a normal human being. man or woman. im asking you please, reconsider. theres so much you could create. please dont destroy yourself. take my hand and ill be there for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">i hear you op. im sorry youve been through so much, you do not deserve the trauma you have endured. please eat, op. something small, something insignificant, anything. some energy in your body can help you feel better, even if just a little bit. you deserve to be happy and to be surrounded by people who care. and you can be, but you need to give it time. killing yourself takes away time, and guarantees that your situation will never be able to improve. stay strong, and leave the door open for better days. lastly, you do have people in the world. however insignificant it may be, you have this community here. you also have your friends. i dont know your situation, but are there any of them you think you could reach out to? all it takes is one. most importantly, you have yourself. as selfless and compassionate as you may be, its perfectly valid to focus on yourself and your own wants and needs. i understand if you arent able to love yourself just yet, but please dont be your own enemy. you deserve to fight this battle alongside yourself, not against yourself.</data>

  <data key="d1">dont be afraid to test the waters with your friends. you sound like the kind of person that would carry them when they needed it, so i wouldnt be at all surprised if they would do the same for you. friends are there for each other. you dont need to unload everything on them either, but even just someone to vent to now and then can make a world of difference. dont look at yourself as a burden, look at yourself as a person who needs a hand to help themselves stand up. youre not lying there as a burden being lifted, your friends are just giving you a little hand to help you off the ground. im sure youve literally helped someone up before. think about it you barely use any strength or effort to pull them up, but thanks to your help they are able to stand up when they couldnt before. its the same here. as long as you dont dump everything at once, youre not overburdening them, but youre getting help and connection that you need. hope this helps, sending internet hugs your way.</data>

  <data key="d1">research positive affirmation. it may seem redundant but the way you talk to yourself legitimately does determine how the world will talk to you. a for seeing the bad in me that isn't something i can offer advice on specifically since i don't know your life, i would suggest seeing a psychologist for 2 or 3 sessions then getting her opinion whether or not medication would be right for you, because it seems from your comment you aren't outwardly depressed just having self image issues, which can be helped by the talk therapy psychologists do, and a medication if needed.</data>

  <data key="d1">woman, not man. i wish i was selling shit, but alas i am not. i had to google that movie, ive never heard of it, but the plot sounds dark and interesting. the reviews are great for it also! you should watch a movie called anomalisa if you have time. youd probably enjoy it! tootaloo! i like that phrase, i think ill start using it thanks! ps planning out a suicide around your work and school schedule is very responsible, but maybe it would be more responsible if you just idk didnt do it at all. take it from someone who tried, failed, and ended up in a mental hospital. it isnt worth it. by you killing yourself you are condemning another innocent human to the trauma of finding your body. not telling you what to do, you do you man, but damn you seem pretty bright, its a shame.</data>

  <data key="d1">youre okay, no worries! do you really like that movie you were watching? ive been looking for something dark lately because october starts the spooky movie season! i already watched halloweentown i would not recommend, it was much better when i was a child, but it isnt very dark just really crappy fake special effects. it came out in the 90s so what can i expect, but it was still disappointing. do you enjoy writing? or do you only do it for the purpose of writing notes?</data>

  <data key="d1">so if you dont get a degree then all youve got is a job like that? im just really confused and curious about the job choices there. for me, having someone to studywork with is the best way to force myself to do schoolwork. with that said, i struggle a lot with schoolwork cuz i dont have any university friends.</data>

  <data key="d1">as someone who has been a doormat for people way too many times, i've developed ways of getting out of that situation. try imagining yourself with all the respect and love you deserve and decide that you do deserve it. set boundaries and act like you respect yourself. admittedly, when you do this, you might lose friends, but the ones you make from then on will actually respect you. if they're bad people, it also cuts off the narcissistic supply they get from putting you down. i've spent a lot of time alone and it completely sucks, but the selfesteem i developed from not having people treat me like a lesser person has allowed me to succeed in life. when you act like someone you yourself would love and hold yourself to a high standard, you attract people who admire you instead of having to fight for other people's attention. tldr put the love and time you give people who don't appreciate you into yourself</data>

  <data key="d1">well, ending your life leaves other people in pain and with responsibilities that were originally yours. but to be fair, expecting someone to keep suffering so people can acknowledge your existence is egoistic too. so i think both sides aren't completely free of being somewhat selfish</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm so sorry for you. you're too young to have problems that hard. look, fight your dad's reentry to your life. remember that in one year you can cut him off for good. you don't owe him jack shit. you've got to protect yourself from his guilting tactics. a drug using friend is far beyond what you can handle. you're not responsible for him. you can't always bail him out. if that's the path he's going down you're going to tell him that there will be a day in which you part your separate ways. not today, not tomorrow but, it is inevtiable. sled harm is bad but, you know that. you're doing it for the relief. that sweet euphoric relief. it's an addiction to have that rush. don't grow to depend on it. if you can, speak to a therapist. if money is an issue, message the mods. they can usually refer you to someone cheap. as you're a minor, i believe that there are free resources for you. i'm really sorry bro. when it rains, it really does pour.</data>

  <data key="d1">hello you might recognise me from. i'm so sorry that your mantids death has made you feel this way. i've got no experience with helping anyone in a situation like yours but i've kept a lot of mantids now. you mentioned that the humidity was too low it may well not have been, mantids do just mismoult sometimes and that's a fact of life in nature, 95 of mantids don't make it to adulthood because they are so extremely vulnerable. i had a mantis mismoult once when all i did was walk into a room i startled her, she fell and mangled herself. my first two mantids, i killed by not providing proper ventilation and they died horrible deaths. i spent a huge amount of time feeling like the worst person in the world for their deaths and i absolutely understand that the death of your mantis is traumatic particularly during these hard times, having a pet has been so beneficial and to lose that is beyond difficult. ultimately though, we can never know truly what the cause of a mantids death is and so blaming ourselves is not worth it. i used the deaths of my mantids to rededicate myself to the care of the others, to hold me to be better for them. and if you can face it, i suggest you do that too never forget those that you have lost, and move on every day dedicated to honouring their memories. i hope that i have perhaps said something of help here. but please, reach out to family, friends or a support networkgroup. don't feel embarrassed about talking about this incident some people think of these as just silly bugs but we both know they mean so much more to us than that. i wish you all the best.</data>

  <data key="d1">to add to the discussion, i don't recommend you getting them as pets since they require a lot of attention and, even with all care, their lifespan is short compared to a dogcat and chances are you'll be feeling horrible and probably blame yourself when it's just nature in the works.</data>

  <data key="d1">youre not even 16. you dont know a damn thing. i dont care how much you think you do or how much youve convinced yourself that your future is set in stone and what exactly that future entails. i hope you make the right choice man. i dont know if youre willing to be convinced otherwise, but its especially hard talking to teenagers about this. because you have a very hard road ahead and your concept of time is preciously little, and the vast majority of your life youve been a child. youre years away even from young adulthood. youll gain experience, knowledge, wisdom, and different perspectives when you age. theres a lot more to life than youre able to understand at your age and that youre willing to contemplate right now. you should take it from someone who was in your place once man. youre talking about permanent devastation when you havent given this ride its full, due chance.</data>

  <data key="d1">youre not condemning yourself to anything. youre committing yourself to carry on with life and experience it full measure for all the pleasure and the pain it will give you for the next many decades, god willing. i get that its hard, but youve very, very prematurely decided what the rest of your life would be like many decades from now. thats crazy talk. just plain crazy. but youre not crazy, youre just young and shortsighted, and your mental pain doesnt help you see through the fog. youve convinced yourself that theres nothing beyond the fog thats right in front of your face, but youre wrong. oh so very wrong.</data>

  <data key="d1">most people endure harsh comments by moving through situations you have right now. thick skin is built through circumstance, not by birth proverbially, and nonproverbially. most people in life feel that they aren't quite sure what they are doing, i don't see a difference in how you feel in how a third party feels. this does not mean your feelings are irrelevant, but it means that they are shared more or less by people, regardless of whether apparent or not. do what you can to push through. hardship provides the richness of leisure. if you don't know where you are going, pick a path and go on it. heading a direction in the wilderness is better than staying where you are. finding a way is better than staying in the woods. if you have no compass, then you will have to use your inuition and wits to stay afloat. you need to a way to make yourself find happiness and meaning, no one else can do that for you. threads and conversations like this is the closest people will get to trying to help you because the rest lays on the individual. take care, alex.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know i dont know you and i dont know your exact situation, but i am familiar with what you said you're feeling. if you find something you enjoy, something that makes you feel accomplished, even if it isn't something that necessarily earns money or whatever, hold onto that shit. just liking something is the best way to get good at something, and i can almost guarantee that there is something you like, or even a few things, that you don't realize you are really good at. a big part of feeling like you are contributing is being around and interacting with people who actually recognize you and your talents. no one is born useless, but you can be born around the wrong people. start by hopping on streams for people that share your passions and get involved, comment, contribute. other people will see that and actually look forward to your input and respect and consider your opinions. just imagine right now you're a fish swimming in a bowl of tap water. not ideal, you need to get to the ocean with your fish homies, my dude. they don't even know they need you yet.</data>

  <data key="d1">you don't need anyone to make you happy. don't just stay with her because you think you need her. from that you described she isn't really the best partner for you. if she can't support you enough you should think about breaking up. get you someone who understands, who is there for you. someone who truly cares about you. i'm so sorry. i know how hard it is. i also know it's really hard to be in a relationship with someone who struggles with mental health issues, at the end of the day you have to decide if she supports you enough. i wish you all the best from the bottom of my heart</data>

  <data key="d1">dude ,first thing i want to say is you have done the right thing by asking for help but i am not an expert so i realy think that you should get help from professionals .they will know how you can make friends and they will not judge your condition depending on your age because feeling depressed is not about age so do not be scared or hesistant.and also do not think about money while getting helped because life is something precious and you only have one chance but you can earn money whenever you want. you can just gooogle where and how to get help from experts.also here is a tip from me about getting new friends,think about your hobbies and which hobby you would probabaly like if you start doing it and try to find groups which are interested in these hobbies because f you have a common point,getting friends gets easier.btw i want to say sorry for my english,it is not my main language.f you need anything more you want to talk about you can ask to me privately.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey man, i'm currently 15 and was feeling extremely suicidal at the exact same age. the thoughts are not worth it dude. your emotions are probably all over the place, you can try distracting yourself though. for me it was exploring new religions and i got into some new hobbies. i swear that it gets better no matter what happens, you're extremely young and i can tell from first hand experience that it will all be fine. suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems. this sounds extremely clich but it's clich because it's true.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey. self diagnosing, been there. after i finally got some help and talked to a psychologist, psychiatrist and did some tests.. i got a legitimate diagnosis and honestly, the feeling of relief, knowing its not you that is broken and wrong, its something inside your head that isnt yours inherently. it was so so much easier feeling like i did after i didnt have to question how i feel they told me im having a bad depressive episode and that its serious. i was finally able to tell my 'youre just lazy, dumb, useless, so selfish you cant even motivate yourself to get up even though you have everything you need in your life' thoughts and anxieties they were wrong. i think talking to a licensed professional might help you in that way, you certainly dont have anything to lose. stay safe</data>

  <data key="d1">there is absolutely no way to avoid hurting your parents. or anyone you ever meant something to. if you've made the decision to kill yourself, you have two understand that you aren't stopping your pain, you're simply passing it onto others. if you don't want to be a liability on your parents, then don't pass your pain onto them. that will make whatever they're struggling with now much, much worse. instead, struggle. struggle and go through the pain and shit and problems that life throws at you. i would give you the whole things get better spiel, but sometimes it doesn't. sometimes you find yourself struggling for life. but that's the difference between those that succeed and those that fail. those that succeed make life happen, whereas those that fail simply let life happen to them. when i attempted suicide, i saw my dad cry and i mean broken hearted sobs for the first time in my life. i was 17 years old at the time. 5 years later, i'm still struggling. and it sucks, but that's what we do as humans. to end my little rent, don't do it. you'll make your mom and dad cry. they love you more than their legacy. trust me on this.</data>

  <data key="d1">im sorry your in so much pain. ive been there a couple times. i know that tired feeling you describe. is there anyone you can talk to about your feelings? not the friends. they might not be mature enough to be able to listen and give you the understanding you need to feel less alone in the world. a therapist or a really smart and sensitive person might be able to provide you with the love and understanding you need right now. thats what you need. love and understanding. may you get all the love and ubderstanding you need.</data>

  <data key="d1">youre very welcome. im happy i was able to help. the people who have hurt the most in life tell us that the secret to getting through pain, intense pain, is having someone to talk to who can understand us, our pain. friends very often dont have the skills to do this, unfortunately. they get judgemental, or bored, or annoyed, or offer advise that doesnt make sense. they tend to invalidate us when we're in pain. look up emotional invalidation. its a very important concept. you need to know who invalidates your feelings, your pain, and who doesnt. therapistscounselors are often a good answer. they're naturally good at listening, being nonjudgmental, and understanding peoples pain, without invalidating. but once you understand the concept of invalidation, you know who you can turn to and who doesnt have good empathy skills. take care and hope you feel better.</data>

  <data key="d1">okay now this is actually what i was gonna write but i felt like y'all needed to here my story to actually understand better if that makes sense. my dad tells me that i'm gonna have to be forced to go to school next year and that i have no choice, i'm on the edge of tears and shit and then i go to my room and have a mental breakdown and slam my fists into my head and my thighs and pull my hair and i'm just all over the place. why did this set me off? it's not a big deal from looking on the outside right? well you're wrong it is a big deal. suffering from an anxiety disorder that makes you rethink constantly about everything that you're doing and making future plans for the next year that you eventually do because you're so afraid of something bad happening. i don't know how to explain my disorder but i suffer from generalized anxiety disorder aka gad and yes as it says generalized anxiety so that pretty much sums it up. in school makes me on the edge so bad that i almost have a panic attack everytime i move to each class and i've always been like this since the third grade too since i got diagnosed with it then too i legit thought having a panic attack when a teacher would go tell you to go walk a lap on the playground as punishment was normal. anyways yeah my mind is pretty much fucked up but y'all are already thinking of some ideas on how i can calm myself down in these situations which you're right but i haven't been out of the house in public public areas since the month before covid started cause i got sick then lol but anyways yes i've been out of the house because my dad is like you're gonna die of scurvy and shit yeah angsty teen moments lol. anyways i've never been to highschool in person and i'm s freshman as well so big step but the problem is last year i was recommended for honors and i got put in standard this was all online school and i cried so much and it really put me down into a darker place than i was i ended up failing the first quarter and now the second one currently because of my depression and now most of y'all must think omfg you're so fucking sensitive just suck it up and do what you need to do mostly what my dad says except minus the swearing but still extremely emotionally abusive. last year i was in advanced for the first time in my life and i've always wanted to be in advanced so i was so overjoyed but then i ended up being admitted to the ward and my grades plumish as well. and going from advanced for the first time in your life and expecting to be put in honors because every teacher recommend it except for math cause you're a dumb mf and you get put in standard for every class makes you hella fucking depressed and this still hurts lmao not me crying while typing this. i'm not gonna go back in person i don't care if my dad hurts me physically i'm not going i can't stand it i'll slit my wrists if i fucking have to i daydream about ways i can kill myself every fucking day and the other night i dreamt about stabbing myself in the chest and dying. i'd rather go back to the ward than go to fucking school and be made fun of, get put in the stupid kids class and when i mean stupid i don't mean medically retarded because i am medically retarded too so i understand why some people are in intensive and some are not i'm talking about how in every standard class there are dumbs motherfuckers who take up the teachers time and fool around like bitch this is my fucking learning time if i would i'd kill you. like at this point in life i'm not afraid to stab a how because i'll fucking do it and then cry if i get caught skdkkf i'm not gonna actually murder someone y'all but anyways yeah</data>

  <data key="d1">i am native american and i was sent to a boarding school against my will. i couldn't understood how my parents were able to rationalize how terrifying that was. no one from my community even knew boarding schools still existed. it was a very isolating experience, physically and emotionally. the native side of the family has a long history of children being orphaned, taken in by other family, or being sent to foster care. i didn't know this until i was older. i learned a lot from reading your post. i grew up fast too, and i feel like i missed out on important lessons from my loved ones. i still have so much to catch up! growing up in a bubble really made me feel different from other people in a way that is hard to explain. x200b thank you for sharing</data>

  <data key="d1">oh no, that's not at all what i meant. i just thought that you would appreciate talking to people who understand a bit more and have been there. i definitely do not think that you should only seek out indigenous run resources, i just genuinely thought it might be helpful. you have every right to go to any resources that you choose. 100 as much right as anyone else. also, i never said your kind. that's always said in a racist way. i'm so sorry that that's been your experience though. i want you to know that i'll remember this comment and i'll take it as a learning opportunity to do better. next time, i won't point someone with a post like yours towards that helpline. i promise you i'll think twice and be more sensitive around the fact that they may feel the same way as you. i'm deeply sorry that i hurt you and i feel horrible. i'm so sorry. i'm crying a lot right now. it's not about me though but i do want you to know that i'm sorry. you deserve help. and i'm very sorry you're suicidal. you deserve to live and to feel better.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm a teenager too, and i also have that pain in the chest when i'm suicidal. i've asked this on reddit before, and i didn't get an answer for why it is happening, but people told me they feel it too. and i have no idea why! im happy, my little fe is great. i have passing grades, ipads, a phone, parents who buy me what i want on most occasions, and good true friends and yet have considered suicide and attempted suicide so much these past few months and nothing wrong is happening around me. relatable, but i think i figured out why i was am suicidal. personally, i don't have a goal in life. there's nothing specifically that i want to achieve, there's nothing i'm trying to achieve. when i tried, it was hard work for nothing. also, i find life meaningless. i don't believe there's anything after death, so everything you built in your life will be gone in an instant when you die you won't be able to remember anything of what you've done, you won't be able to feel proud of it, nothing. all the electronics and other stuff i enjoy, i only consider them distractions. maybe they make me feel happy right in that moment, but other than that? nothing. life is longer than those little moments. i miss the times i wasn't thinking like this. when i didn't consider that life is pointless. since i changed my view on basically everything it started in the spring, once the quarantine started, i'm basically a dead man walking. maybe you don't think life is pointless or you think that you don't think it is. i was just trying to explain why i feel that pain, except having friends, family and money.</data>

  <data key="d1">depression and anxiety can occur no matter how great your life seems from the outside. i'd recommend speaking with your docto therapist as they may be able to help figure out what's going on and what can be done to address it. i've felt deeply depressed even when things in my life were objectively going great. especially as a teen, your brain chemistry is changing a lot with hormones and whatnot sometimes shit just happens. hang in there!</data>

  <data key="d1">for me, the pain and sadness is more of an emptiness. but that emptiness is heavy, like a constant weight on my shoulders. i've learned to carry that weight and suffer in silence for most of my life. it is an internal belief, and acceptance, that i am rotten to the core, and no matter what i ever say or do, that will never change. i wouldn't suggest taking my path. it grows and leads you to sabotage yourself in countless ways. the important thing to remember is that it is okay to feel that way. no matter what anyone tells you, you do not need a justification for it. you do not need a rational explanation to feel that way. most importantly you do not need a reason to feel that way. it is okay. accept that it is there, and that is all. then, tell someone you trust that you feel this way. that you aren't looking to commit suicide, but that you don't understand why you feel this way, and that you want to start examining it. then, you can get guidance on how to seek help. just as we may break bones and seek out a doctor for help, we can hurt our spirits and seek out a professional to help. it may take you visiting several to find one you click with, and that is okay to. just know that it isn't an overnight thing, or that you may never be cured, but please do start looking into this now, as it gets harder as the years go on and you become more set in your ways.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think i am understanding what you are saying. i felt a similar sense of dread that seemed to be focused in my heart. it felt like something lodged deep inside of me. i could feel the puncture in my core. then on bad days yesterday for me it feels like a black hole. like theres a knot in my heart that has immense gravity. it sucks the life force out of me and then i also feel suicidal. i have felt this way for probably 17 years now. for me, its been my fear that has kept me in that cycle. i became too familiar with depression and i allowed it to become my life routine. i was so afraid to change even just a little bit that i would rather die. i realized that i was willing to kill myself as a response to my fear of change. because change is fucking terrifying and hard and you dont know what is out there in the world. but really, if i change and choose to be happier, and really change to choose that i am able to break free of my suicidal thoughts. there is really no lower you can go from wanting to die. making change will bring improvements. so i choose to make my days meaningful in some way or helpful to my mind and heart. also be kind to yourself. yes today was fucking hard. i was completely alone today and really let everything weigh me down. but its okay to feel that way. you can be sad. dont blame yourself or shame yourself for being sad. its an emotion, its yours, its real. not every day is perfect and amazing, so you have to forgive yourself for the moments when youre down. they happen dont dwell on them. forgive yourself and try to make the next day a little better. i dont mean to sound like a preacher but i really feel for you. i started having the same problems that you described at your age. i can see myself in you. i want a better future for you. the path ive been down doesnt have to be the way for everyone. youre ok its ok to be sad even if you dont understand why. just allow yourself to feel, try to understand whats making you feel that way, and forgive yourself for it. we can really choose to do whatever we want in some way everyday. life isnt as restricted as some may think it has to be. you can make room for yourself to be happy. because thats all there really is to life just trying to have joy in whatever circumstance youre in.</data>

  <data key="d1">it sounds like you're describing symptoms of depression and anxiety, but it's best to speak with a medical professional, as i am not a medical professional, nor can a proper diagnosis can be done online. you can have everything in the world and still feel depressed, anxious, andor empty, as there are many causes to such symptoms, such chemical imbalances, trauma, stress, underlying conditions, etc. i'm sorry you feel this way. there are a lot of resources where you can seek help some schools offer counselingtherapy you can ask your primary care provider, if you have one, to refer you to a therapistpsychiatrist andor you can calltext crisis hotline specific to your needs. i wish you the best, happy holidays!</data>

  <data key="d1">existentialism and the inability to not think. at least thats what i think. also a teen so i have a lot of life to live left but that feeling is still there, the thought of nothing im doing matters or that this is a waste of time. most people are able to just go no thats wrong and be done with it live their lives. this leads to you trying desperately to prove that something matters anything untill it dosnt then depression. it wasn't untill i started to take care of something complex that physically needed me to be alive that i was able to push away the thought that i didnt matter and nothing i did was going to matter. if i was dead it wouldn't be alive, i wouldn't have been able to give it a good life, give it a nice home, tend to it the best i could and watch it grow its dumb but its how i got the stupid voice to finally ease up just a little. when the days are bad its really noticibal but on good days im able to feel happy withoght guilt. i think it has to do more with existentialism and out personal worth than anything else. the mind coming to realizations is scary. sorry i know its long but hope this can serve anyone.</data>

  <data key="d1">that feeling is caused by your brain releasing natural chemicals called neurotransmitters. these are essentially your brain's reaction to when it thinks your body is hurt which will cause that heavy heart feeling as well as irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, and even nausea it all depends on the person. what you're feeling is a totally natural response to feeling sad or even scaredoverwhelmed. next time it happens just take some slow deep breaths, try to relax and take your mind off things the reason you're likely feeling these things is because you're separated from your friends and a lot of the outside world due to covid which can definitely make you feel sad even if you don't really consciously think about it, it's likely an effect from lack of social time that you were used to beforehand.</data>

  <data key="d1">i concur. when i was around 10 years old, i started noticing this kind of weird feeling in my chest. it was like pressure like someone pressing down on my chest, or squeezing it from the inside. it also made me feel like my heart was skipping beats and i was out of breath for a few seconds as it was happening. weird feeling. it scared me as at first i thought there was something wrong with my heart, so i told this to my family. i had an examination at the cardiologist and they didn't find anything wrong. in the end, after a few years had passed and i got more aware of anxiety and depression, i realized it was and is exactly that.</data>

  <data key="d1">im so sorry that you feel this way. have you tried reaching out to some of the trans subreddits or seeing if there's online support groups? its heartbreaking to see that your ex friends were so shallow and you deserve much better friends. a support group may be able to help with the anxiety and depression while also providing an opportunity to make friends.</data>

  <data key="d1">you know, maybe it's my years of drug abuse that make it easier, or maybe it's my dread since birth, but regardless , i've found this to be a running theme in my life aswell. it doesn't help that i would 12 hours 5 days a week at a warehouse, being ya know, another brick in the wall. i have no diploma or ged, or even a liscense. my life will probably consists of only work, with no real goal to work towards. just a gear spinning in the machine. with that being said, the only thing that made me comfortable being in one place, letting life pass by, is understanding that life is just that, a passing of time. we all grow and change but we are all just watching the hands of time push. what helps me a lot is going for walks, looking at the people and the leaves as they pass by through the air, think about the funny quirks and thing people and nature have. this have me the realization that all my depression from having nowhere to go in life was me just not realizing where and what i wanted to be. i'd still be depressed if i got that job, or got that extra but of money, ect. obvi it would make things easier but i'd still just want to move up, and have even more trouble dealing with my issues, especially since i can't associate it with position or money. existence is beautiful, and the world around you has great charm. don't let economy dictate your life. you are an organism, now go breath some air and laugh at some dogs wish you the best</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm 22 and felt the same way a couple of times. 2 weeks ago i tried killing myself. when i survived, i expected my mother to realise everything she did to me and change. guess what? she stayed the same way. she started acting worse, as if she was the one suffering the most and not me. she told my boyfriend she had nothing to apologise for, that i was just like my father wanting drama when things don't go his way and hurting others in the process. it took my boyfriend to tell her you weren't the one trying to die and a couple of other things to make her shut up. on the other hand, my cousin tried it too a few years ago and her whole family changed in a good way after it. there is no way to know how people will react to it. i tought if i survived, my mother would act like my cousin's family, but that didn't happen. if you survive, your expectations might be crushed and you might end up even more hurt and depressed.. that's what happened to me.</data>

  <data key="d1">dear, the best revenge is not to serve the dish that the enemy may not have expected butbstill love to see it. the best revenge is to do exactly the opposite. in your case, they'll just pity your after you died. some might even laugh. and some will shed their fake tears and gain sympathy from others and will rise by claiming to be hurt by your action. now see, this all seems totally wrong. a very bad idea which will have a very short term. the best way is to go the long way. and remember, revenge is the best dish when served cold. you don't want others to feel gratification. what you do is keep on living. they don't care about you, so you stop caring about them. a complete focus and determination should be targeted towards your aim in life. make sure it is achieved. you'll be facing many obstacles and stops in life, but know this very well, to reach at place you have never been, you have to do things you never did and achieve that goal. and road to achieving that goal always goes the zone which one is not comfortable with. when you'll reach at the top, it's then when you look at their faces and enjoy the reactions that they give.. at that point, since you never needed those people anyway, you can very comfortably choose to kick out the people who you are in no more need. but for all this, you have to cross the dense and dangerous jungle that lies ahead of you. be strong. and say, hakunamatata. then just ram towards that goal like a raging bull.</data>

  <data key="d1">do you have access to a therapist or counsellor? i think you would find it really beneficial to be able to talk these kinds of feelings out and maybe learn some healthy coping mechanisms when life starts to feel tough. also, depression can cause anger problems, which isn't something that is often acknowledged much, not to mention the added hormones that come with going thru puberty and stress of being a teenager! i know i am someone who is very sensitive to hormonal changes in my body, might be worth getting that checked out? please at least let someone you trust know how low you are feeling, and please try to stay safe. take care and i hope things start to ease for you soon.</data>

  <data key="d1">another option is that you contact the teachers. teachers really appreciate whenever students contact them, and you would be surprised by what support they could offer you. all you have to do is ask. you could either ask them while youre in classat the end of class, or you could send them an emailmessage. i would recommend that you try to contact them in the online class because they might mot always get your emails. here is an email template you can use if you want dear mrsmr.teacher, this is your name from your xth period class. i sent this email to you because i am struggling in this class and i am not sure what to do. i have been trying endlessly to improve my grade, but nothing has helped. i would appreciate if you could help me in some way. thanks for your patience, your name alternatively, you could use resources like khan academy if you are struggling with an assignment in math.</data>

  <data key="d1">oh no, please don't feel so down on yourself! i have not gone through what you are going through but it sounds difficult. i'm a bit harsh on parents because mine were not good, but if you can tell that your parents care about you then they probably do. autism and transgender acceptance is fairly recent in history. dealing with both at the same time is not easy. your parents are not going to make the right choices or know how to act all the time. they probably expected the delusional normal a perfect happy family with no problems. that normal doesn't exist for anyone. everyone is unique, everyone has their challenges and you got dealt a hard hand, but i believe in you! if you can learn how to navigate life as you are you will be so strong when you grow up. just remember that you are enough just for being you. accept yourself even if others don't. do what makes you happy and forgive those who mock you because they have difficulties of their own. live life to the fullest in your own way.</data>

  <data key="d1">you are loved, you are special. and you got this! we are here for you, you are not alone, you are loved! i have been where you are and please know that this too will pass. i have dealt with depression my whole life, and in high school and college was overwhelmed with the type of thoughts you are having now. it will get better! but know that it can get worse before it gets better. when i was 23 i fell off a cliff backcountry skiing and broke my back, damaged the spinal cord. now, i live my life in a wheelchair. then, 2 years and 2 months after my spinal cord injury, i was a passenger in a triple roll over car wreck. the driver was doing 95mph, missed out exit and tried to make it anyway. i was trapped in the car and fighting for my life. i survived with massive injuries, crushed pelvis, broke both femurs, compound fracture of the left and right tibfib, and severed artery, calf muscle and nerves from the passenger side door which hit the guard rail and crushed around me. i had just put my life back together and all of a sudden faced life threatening injuries to my lower extremities and after all the work i had done over the 2 years since my first accident, had to start the recovery and rehab process again from scratch. my skiing accident was in march 2003, the second accident in march 2005. i continue to deal with depression and the impact of both accidents. some days are better than others, but some days are very dark and i feel alone and cursed and helpless and in pain. anything seems better than 1 more day living this life. then one day i will wake up to fresh snow on the ground and an awe inspiring sunrise, and my perspective swings. on these days, i remember how lucky i am to still be here, living this life, and while the struggles persist, i am as tough as they come and will make something beautiful from my time on this earth. you are loved, you are special. and you got this! we are here for you, you are not alone, you are loved! i have been where you are and please know that this too will pass.</data>

  <data key="d1">when i felt worthless, what got me out of it was helping people who crossed my path, protecting other people of the harm i could cause them if i did make a harsh choice and reminding myself that, if i expectneed more from myself and from life, it's because i know i am only tapping the surface of both. don't dive outside of yourself. dive inside and share your light, as big or as tiny you find that spark at the moment, with someone who is in need of more light. any light. your light. crying and allowing yourself to feel is light too. sharing your feelings here today helped me remember a very important moment of connection with myself i had in my life. it was terrifying. and too dangerous. but now i know it was precious and my life after that is indescribably... uh... worth. thank you. really take care you are worth it.</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel for you. i think for most people terms as 'nonbinary' are unfamiliar to an extent that they will act weird around people identifying as such. to be fair, for me it is even unfamiliar and i would not be surprised if i were to misgender someone one day, but i'd never do it on purpose. if your boyfriend issues you an ultimatum like that, i'm sorry to break it, but he might not be the one. may i ask what your pronouns are if i ever message you in this thread again? please realize that you do not have to change for anyone and if people really do not accept you the way you are, then those people might just not be for you. if you really feel you should change for them please just talk to them and never assume the worst just because of your emotional state. 3</data>

  <data key="d1">you are already in great pain. you do not deserve to suffer anymore. i understand that you truly believe that you deserve the worst. but, seriously. you probably go through the worst every single day. there is no need to make it harder for yourself. seeking help is very difficult and sometimes it doesn't work, but believe me when i say you do not want to experience being close to death. it's my experience at least, i don't want to force it upon you. curiosity is fine, but stay safe please. consider other options that may give you solace before trying such a radical thing. of course, the decision is only yours in the end. i am here in case you want to talk about it.</data>

  <data key="d1">what's your job at the moment? why do you not want to go to work anymore if i can ask? designingmaking a video game sounds awesome, i've always shared similar dreams but have never been able to accomplish it. perhaps look for communities with people that want to do the same and try to do it together. it might make it more joyful and less work. people love you, people care about you. i believe you can make an incredible game if you set your mind to it, or at least can create something you're proud of. 3</data>

  <data key="d1">i work at a car making factory. my job is thankfully easy but tiring and pointless. i wish i could get another but i can't. i am bullied at my job and thanks to my disabilities i make stupid mistakes and everyone gets really fucking mad at me. i don't have any friends there. every job i go to it eventually becomes the same. people insult me for my mistakes and assume i'm some sort of child. my sleep has been terrible and i'm trying to get it fixed but i have to wait until i have health insurance again. my only escape is day dreaming about the kinds of games i wanna make and how much love i have for the ones i grew up with. i don't have a girlfriend, i failed college and have little to no money. making a game is i ever wanted to do and i wish i could enjoy this journey.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm not a video game designer so i have little knowledge of the intricacies of programming. i am however a musician.. or at least i'm trying to be! sometimes i think i'm lying calling myself a musician! i havent produced anything in the 5 years that i've been doing this. i've spent so much time and money, and whilst i can see my progression, i do often think that i've wasted a lot and i'll never be as good as i want to. when i feel like this, i like to take a step back and think over why i want to make music. is it for me, for an audience? it might take me another 5 years, or another 10 years. but i'm pretty sure if i keep going, i'll create 'something'. i might not even be happy with my creation, but i'm sure the process will be worth it for me!. keep on programming!</data>

  <data key="d1">ive survived multiple attempts and been hospitalized and it is always fucking scary. lost control back in december of last year and as much as i tried using all the coping skills i knew and learned from therapy and classes, i found myself very close to attempting until i got put in a psych ward against my will. that was a huge wake up call . psych wards suck, i know. having bipolar, it really does feel like the cycles will never end. if you must tell someone, tell someone you trust and who won't freak outcall the copsdoctors if you don't want to go back.</data>

  <data key="d1">yup. def tell someone. i know you are here because these feelings are so huge, you just need to get them out. getting help is a process, not a miracle. i suffer from all of your issues too except bipolar. i made a youtube video about my experiences yesterday and posted on my facebook. after years of medication and therapy. and relapses. and trying again. i am also an addict. i have struggled with sobriety off and on for a long time and there is really no difference in the recovery pattern. sometimes we fall back a little but don't forget the people who love you will help you. you used a lot of words like concerned and worried when talking about your loved ones. those are words synonymous with care and love. tell someone you trust. let them know you are frustrated and need help taking the next step. they will help you. and if they don't listen? tell the next person. the next the next and next until they listen. also, the physical damage you may have done to your body is worth checking on by your gp at least. take care of yourself. we are out here rooting for you and it sounds like so are a lot of people who are much closer.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, i'm so sorry youre in so much pain. yes, tell your friends or just go to the emergency room because you really need to go be checked out. as someone who has attempted suicide and lost numerous friends to suicide typically friends would rather hear you ask for help than hear news you killed yourself if not they aren't your friends. like you, i had been on literally dozens of psych meds and hospitalized dozens of times and done years of therapy with my depression and ptsd. you might not know how you'll get through this, but there might be other times you didn't know how you'd get through and then you did. knowing that helps me when im feeling hopeless and trapped.</data>

  <data key="d1">i can't tell if by them you mean medical professionals or familyfriends. it sounds like you were found by strangers and are talking about medical professionals? this is the assumption i'll work with in my post, but feel free to reply and correct me so i can give better advice if this isn't the case. first off, tell at least one friend. just know that if you tell them, they are likely to feel obligated to act or try to help in some way, so something you can do to make that a positive instead of a harmful action is to define what help looks like to you. maybe it's watching after you, spending time with you. maybe it's cooking you food and helping you take care of your basic needs for a while. reminders of self care, brushing your teeth, taking some time to relax, untense your shoulders and unclench your jaw. maybe it's going with you to the doctor to get medical attention regarding your lungs. whatever might make you feel like you're not alone. try to make sure this friend is someone who understands what it's like having a mental illness, and not someone who thinks the way to get over depression is to just not be sad. i'd never go to my mother for this reason. i'd recommend also telling some medical professionals the truth and selfcommitting yourself into psychiatric care, but i also know this doesn't help everyone. so this step is more... up to your discretion, whatever you think is best for you. as far as what to tell the doctors if you don't want to go to the psych ward, say you were feeling kind of sick that day, you got to the car or got home from work and passed out. and that you're concerned because you know that people can die breathing these fumes. they don't have to know the details. not being able to breathe is a big problem, and if you have difficulties, it will lower the oxygen saturation in your blood, causing you to not be able to think well. it can also cause brain damage if it is severe enough, so i'd heavily recommend getting medical attention for this if for nothing else.</data>

  <data key="d1">np, you too. definitely not out of the woods but things do look a little better recently, summer and the end of covid restrictions have helped, just being able to spend more time outdoors and seeing more life and activity around gives me a bit more energy. i still have so much to change, so much to figure out and feel so incapable of it all but i'm just trying to keep going day by day.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey bro. i just turned 25 and literally i remember playing halo at 14 feeling the same way you do. chilling on the xbox thinking everyday about suicide. no father and my mom worked all the time. its rough. youre not stupid at all whoever said that is an idiot. probably didnt take you serious because of wording or your age, but i hear you. want to talk? whats your favorite video game or anime or twitch streamer some shit, also you will get your taste back no worries.</data>

  <data key="d1">you wanna talk? i know youre in a horrible place, but i wanna give you advice if i can. the closer you get to suicide, try to let yourself to things you wouldnt. i never had horrible social anxiety, but i know what its like. once you see how horrible loneliness is, you really want someone in your life. and if youre really close to suicide, why not try to go out and make a friend? or talk to some friends youre not that close to, but you wanna be with? i think self acceptance and self love are also very needed if you wanna get better. so try to stop any suicidal jokes or thoughts in your head by being like no, im in a bad place, and it can get better i really wish you all the best, hope you can find someone to be friends with and get better. good luck</data>

  <data key="d1">i know you're trying to help but just use common sense bro probably not the best verbiage to use with someone in the midst of the worst depressive episode of their life. it's not a matter of using common sense. aside from that, it sounds like there's a lot more to it for op than just their job. op, hope you have not gone through with it and won't. i know exactly how hopeless you feel right now. i even agree with some of it, even now, like life being pointless, but that can either be a good or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. it's pointless, so why not just say fuck it all and live how you want from this moment forward?</data>

  <data key="d1">hey there, this is a really tough situation for you to be in, and i'm sorry that you're here. i think it's really admirable that you've been doing so much to help this internet friend of yours. but if it's really starting to hurt you mentally, then i personally think that you've done all that you can do, unfortunately. it's probably the toughest part of talking to suicidal people, sometimes you can do everything you can, but you still won't be able to help everybody that you try to. and that's ok. it's a tough thing to deal with, and it's usual to blame yourself if something happens, i know i've blamed myself when things go badly with people i talk to online as well. but it's something that happens, and i think you've done a lot for him up to this point. it might not be obvious, but if other people look to you to help him, then it's obvious you've been doing something right. of course, at the end of the day, it's something that you have to decide for yourself. if you want to keep helping him, and you think it's better for you mentally in the long run, then you should keep going. but if you know it's going to help him by sacrificing you, then you probably need to stop. good luck with your friend, and i hope you're feeling a little happier soon as well.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm sorry that your family treats you poorly, you deserve better than that. fuck both our families tbh, shitty parents especially. don't fucking have kids if you are gonna treat them like absolute shit and ruin their chances of functioning like a normal person. one of the main reasons, if not the the main reason i feel so fucking depressed all the time is because of my shitty abusive parents. i have to wake up to their voices everyday and they constantly control what i do so i can't even leave. i would have killed myself longer ago but i was waiting until i was of legal age to get a job, now i am but covid has fucked that up. it just feels like the entire universe is pushing me towards killing myself, legit laughing at me. i can't open up to nobody, all i do is push my feelings down and it feels like i am dying inside because of that. online is the only way i can vent but it's not the same. we deserve better than our shit families</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah, i know people with autism and adhd that get brain fog. personally, i need caffeine to be able to focus my thoughts. some days, it doesn't matter how much coffee i drink... i've been on prescribed stimulants before when it's been bad enough. when i was at the lowest point in my life, i fought to get an adhd diagnosis so i could get medication. because i knew that i needed something stronger to help me break through.</data>

  <data key="d0">comment</data>
  <data key="d1">yes, i do struggle with that at times. lots of people with adhd or autism or both have those struggles. i'm in a bunch of facebook groups, the best ones are the ones where the mods and admins are autistic or adhd themselves. i was on ritalin before, but i'm not a huge fan. there are newer drugs with time release like concerta that have been life changers for people i know. with adhd, a diagnosis seems useful because there are so many potential ways of getting help. with autism, i'm less sure... but that's only because it seems like the help that exists is for children. however, i've been told that there is medication you can get for autism now. part of what i've found powerful has been talking to others in facebook groups and seeing how not alone i am... being able to see someone post about a personal struggle and others helping to brainstorm solutions.</data>

<node id="8844">
  <data key="d0">comment</data>
  <data key="d1">i mean... in a way, it's both? i can't separate my mental illness from my personality because it informs my perspective on the world, it shapes how i think, the connections i make. truthfully, i've found ways in which it serves me. the biggest struggle is being neurodivergent in a world that caters to neurotypical people. if the world catered to neurodivergent people, neurotypical people would seem dumb and slow. see... neurotypical people usually can't keep up with the speed at which my mind makes connections. so it feels jarring to them. but around neurodivergent people, they can follow and they throw in twists of their own. conversations are more fulfilling and interesting. even if we sometimes are left with a how on earth did we start talking about that?! moment. caffeine helps when my brain is disjointed. my doctor once explained it as being that half of my brain runs faster than the other half, so stimulants like caffeine or ritalin help the other half catch up.</data>

  <data key="d1">so im just slow then? coz i dont relate to what you just said my brain doesnt work as fast as others it takes me a while to make connections and i cant think on the spot i can barely come up with a couple words replies at a time i cant make conversations even with those that are supposedly autistic im in a server with a bunch of people who are anything but normies and i cant socialize theyre chill and nice but i look at how they talk to each other and idk why i cant do the same its to the point i would observe them chatting and try to analyze how did the conversation start and how do they keep it going and what did they reply to this and that.. should also mention i pretty much missed on socializing growing up could that be adhd combined with lack of social skills maybe?</data>

  <data key="d1">truthfully? that sounds more like some of the experiences i've read from autistic people. it's a spectrum and everyone has different strengths and weaknesses. there is this thing, scripting, that a lot of us do. it's planning out possible conversations in advance, before having them. plus... i have a lot of friends who prefer talking online because written communication is better for them. i think some of them are even neurotypical, but aren't great thinking on their feet. also? i should be clear that it's a skill and it doesn't happen overnight. i found that age and life experiences helped. when i was a teenager, i didn't really have anything to talk about. now, i've got stories of what's happened to me or to people i've known. plus random information i've learned about various topics i've decided to read about. hobbies, books, movies... plus, just asking questions that encourage others to talk. you never know what you might learn from others.</data>

  <data key="d1">i like your outlook. everything is pretty absurd and meaningless. we all want something. ive been searching for one thing in particular my entire life and havent found it. it seems the universe forgot about me. i also used to be religious. i was trapped in a cult church for 5 years and when i finally left it was so freeing. it was a reformed church, so we celebrated the reformation and weirdos like john calvin, a murderer who didnt exercise the grace of christ but who killed people for their sins. i feel you though. i feel like i have no purpose. i was much happier when i was a dumb blind christian, content to believe that im a baby maker and a housewife, and those are my duties never was a stay at home wife or mom, i worked, but i had the submissive mind of a brainwashed cult member. fortunately left that mess after i had my second child and people started trying to dictate where my children would go during the service tried to separate me from my kids and i just had a deep gut feeling not to leave my children alone with anyone. i stopped attending and was threatened with church discipline and made to feel like i was their property. i finally yelled at the pastor on the phone to leave me alone. it took me awhile to outprocess all that. now i feel like there just isnt any purpose in the world... unless i would meet someone im getting divorced soon, finally after being separated for a long time. then maybe i could share my life with a companion. but im just a single mom, on quarantine, working at home. i feel like i have nobody in this entire world. out of all these people in this world and i havent even found one to share life with.</data>

  <data key="d1">that sounds intense. im sorry you went through all that. that must've been really hard to have your whole worldview change like that. for me, i was essentially just a lazy catholic as a kid. i went to midnight mass on christmas, and i read the bible with my mom a lot. then i watched my dad go through a lot of suffering, and that caused me to start questioning. even though i stopped believing so long ago, i still feel that lack of direction very poignantly. being told all your life that you are beautiful and perfect and hand crafted leaves you with a sense of purpose and like there must be something good about you. learning it's all a lie is painful. i feel that loneliness too. i don't have much to say about it, but i relate to the things you wrote.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes yes yes!! you hit the nail on the head. being told those lies about being perfect and beautiful do make you feel like you have a purpose. but that purpose is often made to feel like a mystery. a lot of christians are even confused about their so called purpose. i used to feel like god was my best friend. i talked to him a lot, and spent a lot of time with him. i still have strong cognitive dissonance about god and then science. ive heard it said that religion is a coping mechanism for a painful reality. i cant say i disagree. i can imagine the break from catholicism would be painful because there are a lot of customs and actions involved. i think i could see where someone could get their identity wrapped up in it. yea it was traumatic and very intense to go through that. ill never go back.</data>

  <data key="d1">none of that is your fault! i've attempted suicide before and have broken down from stress and depression. once i just let out this scream because i couldn't take it anymore. it can become too much. i have even selfharmed myself before, even as a way to punish myself. sounds like you need to get away from your mom. is there anyone you can stay with friends, family or a partner? i'm so sorry you're going through so much. do you need to talk? i'm all ears!</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm sorry to hear that. i don't know if you're 18 or not or if you're currently working. maybe you could come up with a plan to find your own place, even if it was renting a room in someone's house. i know that could be difficult right now with this pandemic but maybe it could be a future plan? in my experience of volunteering, which i am not currently doing because of the pandemic, it felt like i was having some me time and not just being at home with everyone. kind of like i was having a few moments away from everyone. even if you could get away for a few hours, whether it's at school or work, that's still good. if you are not currently doing both, i apologize.</data>

  <data key="d1">honestly, bpd is a mental illness but its not an excuse. i have strong traits and i have friends with it. we make our own bed and know right from wrong. i never cheated, one of my friends with a diagnosis has whilst another one always does on every girlfriend. you cant let yourself be held hostage by this person, they betrayed you which means they didnt value at the time enough to consider you over their own insecurities and selfishness. bpd sucks but its not an excuse, just like aspd isnt an excuse to become a serial killer. walkaway and let yourself heal, if youre genuinely concerned, call her parents and the emergency services, she wont get better if you stay, shell just become more clingy and desperate and more toxic over time.</data>

  <data key="d1">is it okay to call her parents when they are conservative and don't know about our relationship? i feel like that might backfire on me, if they accuse me of anything although i have chat records etc because i'm pretty sure my gf won't tell them how i've been spending half my salary getting her therapy and sustaining her with her doing little work around the house. her dad sends her pocket money enough for a college student, which makes me believe he might care. i just wonder if it's unsafe to call her parents up on her, because she has cut off from her dad multiple times, accusing him of not divorcing her abusive mom, and not 'getting' why she's upset and sad.</data>

  <data key="d1">if theyre not trusted people then i would avoid it and involve someone she can trust. maybe she can stay with a friend for a week or so whilst she gets things together. at this point your concious needs to be clear, so personally if i was really worried, id call the mental health team if no one else will take her on. a warning, after you break up, she will likely try to persuade you she has learnt her lesson and realised her love for you etc. dont buy into it, she wont have changed. it takes years of therapy with bpd for it to have any real effect, if it even does.</data>

  <data key="d1">well i'm not sure if it counts as an attempt, but one time i was going to overdose and i had everything ready in front of me i got this out of body feeling like this is actually happening, its pretty strange actually and there was this part of me that was against it but it was just in the background, it didn't feel real. my mind came up with a bunch of different scenarios too, i don't think i could properly grasp the concept of death at that moment. even now when i think of it, it feels like a dream. the reason i didn't though was because i ended up hearing this voice and it scared me so much i woke up, i havent heard it since then but that was definitely one of the scariest moments of my life. i think it was then though that i realised i didn't want to necessarily kill myself i just didn't want to exist in the first place. its horrible when ur mind and body want two different things.</data>

  <data key="d1">i also attempted two years ago. it was the first day of high school, midnight and i tried to overdose. didn't work cause i couldn't swallow so many pills, it made me sick. did not thought it through, it happened out of impulse even though i thought for months that if i had enough i would just do it. i had experienced the worst anxiety in my life and was on the verge of tears the whole day. when i realized that i haven't taken even half the pills, i stopped cause i knew it wouldn't work. ended in the hospital cause i wouldn't stop vomiting and shaking, even though it was hot outside. turns out after all that vomiting there was no trace of pills so nobody found out i tried to kill myself. that was a relief! i also felt something like a rush, thought it was god telling me not toi'm not religious in any way, but later realized it was my brain not grasping the idea i would just die, i guess it was fea. i came to the conclusion that there were things i still wanted to do, even to this day, like kiss a guymaybe have sex, although unlikely, i don't thrust people, finish my favorite book series, see a tv show i was looking forward to for months, attend a concert of my favorite band etc. i guess the only reason i'm still alive is because of small pleasures life has to offer and because i haven't found a painless way to die that will 100 work.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think you are stronger than you think, i mean you're still here and that alone is amazing. it will take time, but in the mean time try to replace the self hate and negativity with positivity i hope that doesn't sound corny lol, like think about it, how many times have you thought about committing suicide and you're still here to tell the story, which is an accomplishment i would say. every time you overcome a negative thought, you're accomplishing something and being successful, and suicidal thoughts are the literal worst thoughts to have but you've been able to overcome them before, so just try to focus on that. i hope you're able to reach out to someone since you got help before, and that's another thing you were able to talk to people. i'm assuming that means people care about you, so try to remember that people care about you, homie, and obviously i care too since i wrote a paragraph haha</data>

  <data key="d1">as someone who is hebe himself, i can definitely understand the frustration and these feelings you're going through. it doesn't seem to be exclusive for you though which is a good thing. other people don't have that luck. you chose already that you're not ever going to touch minors, something you should be proud of yourself for because i know how hard it can be at times, it shows that you're strong and willing to resist these urges. you're not a monster, nor are you an abomination. you never chose to have this attraction, it happened and you handle it really well imo.</data>

  <data key="d1">dont ask for help from a school, friends or other unqualified person. most people think they stand people with mental illness but dont understand it. its impossible to grasp until you experience it and it seems dramatic or attention seeking to the outside world. mental health professionals only really understand it. even most people who experience it dont understand it or perceive it correctly in themselves. as youre concerned about people perceiving you as edgy i assume youre a teenager as you would realise how little this matters if you were much older. seek a psychiatrist or psychologist and get help. it cant be improved unless you go down this route. even school councillors are extremely unqualified and simply dont have your interests at heart. you cant fully trust them as they are umployed by the school.</data>

  <data key="d1">at some point, i noticed that from being on the internet or from friends, i decided that talking about suicidal idealation was really cringy and edgy and that kept me from it for years and i still struggle with it in outpatient and lie a lot about my si just know that professionals won't find it edgy at all. their entire passion and career is listening and helping and figuring out how to help you get through your issues. even other patients in psych hospitals or outpatient won't find it edgy. it's been the hardest thing for me to learn. i cant talk to my friends about it because i struggle with the same issues. but it's not edgy to talk about, it's a serious topic with serious and heavy feelings. try not to be mean to yourself more when you already probably struggle with those issues on a daily basis. you just have to find the right support, as daunting as it can be, and others with experience with si won't ever find it edgy because they understand. best of luck!</data>

  <data key="d1">yes the simple fact is someone is a councillor. a councillor is the lowest form of mental health practitioner if they can even be considered that. their job role is to talk and the advice they can provide is extremely limited. their responsibility comes down to protecting the schools interests before yours which means they will report you for anything you say thats alarming to them which is going to be more harmful if you have things at home you need to be kept secret until youre ready to speak out about it.</data>

  <data key="d1">im so sorry youre feeling this way, to be honest this relationship sounds like your wife is a narcissistic abuser. when someone is abused by a narcissist, they alienate you from your friends and family, to make you emotionally dependent on them which makes you broken by them and gaslights you. this is not a healthy relationship op, and i strongly suggest you divorce. theres no sense in trying to talk to an abuser, they will lie, they will manipulate. please look up narcissistic abuse and see if your situation fits this, because i think it will. you may also want to look at for some more guidance. i hope you can change your situation around op there is hope for you and i will be praying for you 3</data>

  <data key="d1">you need to calm down first. take some time away from people, spend time alone, maybe doing something you like, just take your mind off things for a while. once you've calmed down, talk to your wife, and go to a relationship therapy if you need to. if you've tried everything, and nothing worked, you might want to divorce. this is completely up to you, so do what is comfortable for you my guy. hope this situation gets resolved soon!</data>

  <data key="d1">i think most people underestimate you. i think they aren't realizing how serious your pain is. and i know how frustrating that is... it is like you have to scream and demand sh for someone to even just talk to you. i know it is unfair, but in my experience, it helps to get comfortable in asking for help. because usually, people are willing, they are just extremely unaware.. so based on how you are feeling, i want to encourage you to reach out even though it feels like they should be reaching out to you. because if they knew how desperate you are feeling, they would stop and listen.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know. and i wish i could say something profound to change your mind. one thing i will say is it might help you to talk to those around you about how you are feeling. because you might be selfsabotaging yourself by not letting them speak on whathow they feel about you. often and i say this because i am guilty of it too we assume the worst and by not doublechecking with those around us there is no way we can ever correct ourselves. in a way, i am asking you to prove me wrong by talking to them. and look, i obviously don't know you but you are special. there is only you. and i hope through these experiences you can learn what makes you special and what your contribution is.</data>

  <data key="d1">i whole heartedly agree and furthermore in my experience i have found that people will say that they support you but they're never proactive about it and that's a problem for people who tend to withdraw because of their depression and so forth. in other words there's no action on their part. and it should seem pretty obvious that if you are isolated and alone etc, that you are experiencing difficulty and that by you continually having to ask for that support you begin to feel like you're begging for it and it feels demeaning. to me it feels like i'm trying to force others to love me but sorry homie don't play that. if i have to ingratiate myself to others i'd rather not. the reality is that people are uncomfortable around those who are suffering. the most troubling trend i see is the lack of humanity especially in the developed world where there is little to no human contact even if there was no covid and i'm concerned that this isolationist trend will continue if and when covid has been contained enough to allow social interaction without protection. in this a trend like what is going on, i believe that suicide rates will continue to climb. i hate to sound bleak but when you live it, you see it and you feel it. i imagine the best thing you could do is to reach out to those even less fortunate than yourself if you seem there are any to be found. perhaps to receive humanity you must give humanity. best of luck!</data>

  <data key="d1">very few people deserve death. i would tentatively not count you among them. i doubt you've done anything terrible enough to have actually earned death. kinda sounds like the point of living for you is just to continue the species, so i askwhy do you give a shit about the species and care how its evolution pans out? if that's your only reason for wanting to die, i think that's very silly and not a very strong reason to want something so final. so let's talk about what else is going on.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey dont feel stupid i understand. i too am failing online school this year and so are so many others. dont feel alone because you arent. school is so damn pointless in my opinion and you can still be successful if you do bad in school. i understand school is hell but there is so many reasons to stay alive. please find those reasons and find hobbies to distract yourself. i am proud of you for trying so hard and for still holding on. i am always here if you would like to vent some more to me. you deserve to love and you deserve to be happy. dont let school ruin your life please. take care and please dont harm yourself</data>

  <data key="d1">hi suicidal too but hope you try push through this. dont let you limited sexual encounter determine how good at sex you can be. with the right partner you can learn and its just about communication and compatibility etc. not sure if its the main reason because that can always change. its harder when you are under pressure to marry. i think you should go at your own pace. se what mental health support you can find and try to see if you can resolve that. a relationship should come when you are in a healthier frame of mind, work on you first.</data>

  <data key="d1">first of all, even with the pain you're going through, i'm wishing you a happy birthday, op. i hear you on age and milestones being triggering. i wish i knew what to do about that i go through that myself. i'm so, so thrilled to hear that you have an amazing family that loves and supports you. do you think they would be there for you if you were to talk about how you feel about your age and feeling behind and discouraged? i'm here for you now, but i only say that because...one time, when i was really low and thinking this topic, i called my mom on a whim and something changed in her where she was exactly as supportive as i needed, which surprised me. and it helped me more than i thought was possible from a parent on this subject. i'm hoping the best for you and your wellbeing right now. i hear your pain and i just want you to know you're not alone.</data>

  <data key="d1">id say first of all, you need new friends. people to remind you that youre a person that genuinely matters to them. just being a bit worried about your sh injuries isnt good enough. hell, thats not even the bare fucking minimum. the fact that dont care shows who they really are and reflects on them, not you. i know im a stranger, but im more than happy to listen if you need someone to talk to. dont get me wrong, its great that you care about them and you really do seem like a really sweet and friendly person, but youre not getting that same respect back in return. find people that will do that for you. people like what youre describing will only make you more alone than you are now. fuck them all. theyre fake friends and you need some real ones in your corner. this isnt your fault of course, but that doesnt mean you cant change that. you may not be able to choose your family, but you can choose your friends. hell, you can choose me if you want. im always happy to make new friends.</data>

  <data key="d1">i kinda get that feeling of being trapped in that depressive state, that you know it will go, but you also know it might come back again and again. and in the middle of it, it feels like an eternal inescapable nightmare. but it's good you have people around who love you and need you. they're there for you, you may ask for help, and if you can't value yourself enough to be able to care about future you, you can consider caring about them. suicide is an immense trauma to all close ones around the person who committed it parents, siblings, friends, partners. it's a never healing wound. i also get that selfdestructive willing for things to screw up so that you could get like powered by that pain. i did get that too. it may feel like depression is inevitable, if it's recurring or you're really deep in. that's ok. but it's like the waves it comes and goes, and when it goes away, you'll be able to perceive things differently. it might be really bad now, it might get worse at some point, but it also might get better. and when it gets better, if you look back, you'll see yourself, when you could harm people, and you were sad and in pain so bad it was hardly manageable and you chose not to. and that's something to be proud of. don't be afraid to talk about it and seek help. suicide is really a last resort, and that's an option you will always have. you can try other things opening up, getting treatment, getting therapy. and if you manage through, your future self will be so proud and grateful for you for not giving up at your worst. if you want to talk more to me, i'm here for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">wow your therapist called you dumb for smoking medical weed? that's so unprofessional. was it because they worried about your meds reacting to it or something? i'm also surprised about what your therapist said. i hope you don't harm yourself because you sound like you're going through enough torture as it is. and you're right everyone does say reach out for help, but it's hard for people to maintain walking along side you through depression since it's usually a long road and not an easy fix. however, connecting with people who understand can be so beneficial. i'm sorry you are going through a tough time right now and i genuinely hope things start working out for you again</data>

  <data key="d1">i would think if weed improves your personal quality of life then she shouldn't be so dismissive. right now the evidence isn't conclusive either way, but it genuinely helps some people especially with pain. i don't even like weed because i get panicked when i smoke it, but she shouldn't call it dumb when you're just trying to figure out a way through life that is beneficial for you. anyway, i'm rooting for you! thank you so much for the compliment but it helps me also to connect as i struggle too and don't know anyone in my life who is depressed. reminds me we aren't alone</data>

  <data key="d1">ive been there too! i understand! it can be really tough to stay motivated, especially when it is impedent with everything online. your not alone because there are many people struggling in this environment and many feeling more depressed than usual. im sure your parents just want to see you succeed and it comes from a good place. my parents are quite old fashioned and they sometimes have a difficult time relating to my struggles depression and current academics. they also say i am being lazy sometimes honestly, they arent wrong, but like you, ive struggled with keeping motivated over the last year. keep moving forward. if you need to take a break to reflect on things. do it! the one thing i really regret is never taking a gap year. there are so many things you can do to turn around academics changing fields sometimes, schools etc, but take time to reflect on what you want to do, not your parents. and if you do end up taking a gap year, fill it with work or volunteering and hobbies to search for your passion and also gain some good experience. and to give you some inspiration, i know a girl who nearly got kicked out of university after bad grades for two years. her parents were very strict, so she secretly dropped out and worked a full time job for a year. she reapplied to arts, aced everything and got into law school. her parents still dont know haha. remember that we are meant to make mistakes in life, its what we do after those mistakes that matter. learn from them, explore life and find what makes you tick</data>

  <data key="d1">a common misconception that a lot of us have to deal with from other people who do not understand the illness and how it serious it is. im sorry you have to deal with this coming from your parents. that type of judgement and lack of understanding makes things so much worse. alone in your struggle. they might not understand but theyre so many of us that do! you are not alone! there are people out there who understand. it would really benefit you to get professional help but if your parents arent taking you seriously i can see how that would be a problem. have you tried reaching out to a school counselor or confiding in a trusted friend or family members who is more understanding ? they may be able to talk to your parents and explain things or give you some guidance on where to go. theres still hope , your situation can change and you wont alway be stuck in the misery. dont give up yet!</data>

  <data key="d1">this hit me. i can feel that you feel the burden of the world. consciousness can feel like your head is trapped in the lion's jaw and there's no escape. i do think of it like that. i also struggle with the things you mention about the world the pressures of communicating in a format others require, the broken systems of human invention, the demands and beaucracy of school and other institutions, etc. and philosophically i have looked closely at antinatalism and nihilism. first of all you are a phenomenal writer. second, you strike me as a big picture thinker. as a big picture thinker, i believe you can see that many of your challenges and discomforts can be relieved with time, training and maturity. for example, introverts possess unique advantages in the social realm employment, dating, etc because they can so easily reflect and refine their approaches. research is showing that introverts make phenomenal leaders for example, ceos and have social abilities that uniquely benefit themselves and others. however, there is the higher question of whether human life is valuable and what is the purpose of human existence, more specifically, your individual life. interestingly, humanity has explored this question since language was purposed. there are treasure troves of highly inspiring approaches to the predicament of life that still inspire thousands of years later. stoic philosophy, existential philosophy, shakespeare and great literature can help guide travellors and reinvigorate their sense of purpose. if you don't mind my saying, i believe you simply have not discovered what answers and insights await you that can guide you through your path. you simply just don't know it yet. but you will continue to grow like you have unto this point. i think you are looking at the deep, hard, core questions of human life. it's hard, it's painful and it can be isolating, but these years may be planting the seeds for future understanding. like the lotus flower, the mud and darkness that it originates from later becomes the source of nutrients that nurture it to bloom and reach the light of the sun. i don't want you to note the problems of human existence and simply stop there. that's just phase 1. you seem ripe for phase 2 okay, so this is so... now what is the absolute best thing i can do in this situation?. you seem interested in phase 2 because you're posting this and have already been searching for answers and seeking your own meaning. i encourage you to remain willing to continue with the life process as it holds surprises, twists and turns. like the yin yang, that which torments us can actually morph into that which teaches, inspires and develops us. for example, how could the act of love be possible if life were perfectly understood and free of mystery? to see a stranger who lives in the same nihilistic universe as anyone else take the daring risk to paint a painting is simply remarkable and is a victory of the power of the human spirit. this is one example, there are many others a thousand ways to kiss the earth. plus, the world needs you already, as there are travellers in life on similar paths as yours but you're already far ahead of them and they need a latern. the further you walk the mystery, the more people who need to see the path you cleared. if you keep going, you may be surprised to learn how strong you become, and how others will look at you to see if they can keep going. it is your existential choice to say yes to your life, the life of your neighbor, the value of the earth, and that it's a good thing that is something here in the universe rather than absolutely nothing at all.</data>

  <data key="d1">this was me...then i actually had abnormal mri results for a brain scan and i couldnt decide what i felt. sometimes relieved and then other times fearful and hoping i have more time. i feel thankful to say now that im relieved that its not a tumor. i hear you on feeling terminally ill. im basically chronically ill despite being oddly physically healthy. it comes with so many challenges and limitations. i get frustrated with people who have no idea. youre very right about dying alone with depression. currently im feeling like its a life sentence of loneliness and isolation.</data>

  <data key="d1">they also make depression look romantic. depression is a chronic, often terminal illness. a lot of terminally ill patients have the option to choose medically assisted suicide rather than going through invasive treatments. they get to have that dignity in how they die, painlessly and have their loved ones with them. i will likely die painfully, alone in a hotel room, hurting the few i haven't yet pushed away because of ignorant perspectives like this.</data>

  <data key="d1">i was just thinking about that. last few months i have been hurting my self and when i told my gf and saw her so sad about that i felt guilty. then fantasizing about dying with cancer or covid or a heart attack just felt amazing. i mean, it's so much easier to say good bye when u dont have a guilty conscience about that and u can say oh, it's not my fault after all. so people won't be disappointed with you and won't blame themselves about that. but in the end, thinking about that makes me feel more guilty and terribly sad and then my thoughts usually turns to the usual suicidal fantasizes.</data>

  <data key="d1">wow. thats a lot going on. it seems that your therapist is aware that your mom doesnt want you to tell her about these thoughts. is there any way you could have tell your mom about the thoughts with the therapist present, and address how she is brushing them off with both of them together? also, does your therapist know how abusive your father is? theres a possibility she could get you in touch with cps you could get into a better place where you wouldnt be living with either of them, but that doesnt at all mean youd never see your mom again or keep a relationship with her.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, youre in a shitty situation, youre allowed to vent. as for the suicide hotline, thats one of their big problems they have too many callers and not enough staff. you say you want to leave but cant imagine doing so. do you know why? is it that you feel trapped, or that you feel something bad would happen if you did? if you are able to get your therapist to contact cps, i believe they can make a surprise visit, so neither of your parents would know. if possible, use your phone to make audio recordings of things that happen as proof. in the best case scenario, youd be able to get out and be either with a foster family or even live with a family member whos willing to take you in. even if your siblings dont believe you, if its courtordered, your mom and dad wouldnt be able to see and talk to you alone. im trying to think of other possible things that could help. please remember youre not alone even if you are technically physically alone. and even if you ever think others have it worse, so what? theyre not you and youre not them. youre the only one experiencing your specific situation and feeling your emotions, and youre allowed to have them despite what anyone tells you.</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel bad for any mistreatment you have received from others. the world is cruel and unfair and there is always inequality and unjust but as there is, there is happiness and a force of good. suicide is not the answer, is there positive people, friends or family, that you can get support from? just need to channel that energy to something positive and happy. if you want to chat, lets talk! you deserve happiness</data>

  <data key="d1">hi, thank you for sharing. sounds like you are having a pretty rough ride with life. i can't really speak to everything you said, but don't kill yourself if you're still a virgin at 30. that's ok, we all grow in pur own time, and a lot of people are still virgins at 30. hell, in some religions that is an achievement, not a thing to shun. i can definitely relate that setting yourself a conditional date can set your mind at ease. it means you have standards and know what you find unacceptable. i don't know how much this will help, but if you are set on the conditional date decision you've made, think of it as a deadline. take the next 2 years and work on yourself as much as you can. and talk to your sister. she doesn't want to see you dead, and she might be able to help.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey that's great to hear, getting into college is itself an accomplishment. working on yourself is tedious and long, but if you stick to it, the benefits of doing so slowly start to accumulate. that you're 26 not 28 is even better, means you have that much extra time. with regards to becoming old and alone, there's a couple things. it's still possible to have meaningful and rewarding relationships with a couple friends, even if you haven't found it in a romantic relationship. sure that's not the same, but it can still be worth it it's fucking tough out there , i know.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah i feel you on that buddy. going to spare you the details, but same story here. even worse is that i messed things up with my selfishness and stupidity. i know life, or at least this iteration, isn't for me. i really get that feeling of just being in that weird limbo state. i've honestly just given up on life and i've stopped trying. i don't leave my room except to go to work, and i don't even leave my room during weekends. i just drink from a bottle, pee in a different one, and i just don't leave. i don't eat, because what's the point. food and drink just all tastes like dust to me. i haven't done my laundry in about half a year and i just wear the same clothes every day because i just don't care about what people think of me at this point. i haven't used deodorant or used soap or shampoo for just about the same time, because again what's the point. i haven't shaved or cut my hair for about the same length of time. i used to shave at least twice a week. one of my coworkers told me i looked like i was on drugs or something. i could only grimly smile at her. women just instinctively know if there's something wrong, they have higher levels of emotional intelligence than men. they're acutely aware, and are able to proactively avoid men with mental health ailments, in particular men who show any signs of desperation or insecurity. they don't want that in their lives, so people like us are thrown away. which of course, is our fault. people will say all kinds of things like how we deserve love and all that, but deserving something and actually getting it are two entirely different things entirely. one is a matter of desire, and the other is a matter of reality. most people get what they want. we don't. i've already, at least, informed my family that i just don't care about life anymore. i already informed them that they shouldn't be surprised if i decide to check out one day. i just want to die, but there's no painless way that i have access to yet. soon. soon though.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey bud, im 26 male. i feel you. im to the point where i have no hope in love personally. i dont even feel anything towards women anymore, just numbness. its like i know love is just chemicals and neural connections making me addicted to someone. its pointless for me, because i cant love or feel love anymore.</data>

  <data key="d1">thank your for this authentic reply. you described what did you stop doing, what does it mean to you to give up on life but what is it like? how does it feel like? did it help to bring some relief or liberation? the thing is that we don't deserve anything because that would imply someone or something owes it to us. but that's not how the world works, the world doesn't owe us anything. it doesn't mean we are not worthy of love, though. we are and yet we won't most likely ever get it. i think you're right and it's connected to the insecurity and desperation, but the older we get the harder it seems to be to change it. by each rejection it gets a little bit harder to stay optimistic.</data>

  <data key="d1">i just don't care about responsibilities or anything. i just don't care. like it's all going to end in suffering anyways. so i just wait until the suffering happens. it doesn't bring any relief at all. but having hope and being let down is worse. after sufficient pain and suffering you'd think that you would at least deserve something. after insane amounts of hard work and sacrifice, and all the hardship and misfortune, you'd think that something good was bound to happen. after enduring this insanity and madness for a long time, for trying to selfimprove and to make yourself a worth person. but this life taught me that some people are not meant to be happy. some people don't deserve love. some people are just doomed from the start. and there's nothing that can be done to change that. something so far beyond the mind or body of a given person. things that a single individual can't change. it's a matter of fate. and fate dictated a terrible life for us. there's nothing wrong with opting out. i just want to be dead. i'm over with this life.</data>

  <data key="d1">well at least an endless stream of rejections you feel love. i feel like i think you have hope and that theres a reason for that. youll probably find love, youre at least finding connections. i dont feel anything anymore, looking and talking to women i know ill never be loved or be able to love and trust someone ever.</data>

  <data key="d1">well, this was not easy to read. sometimes i wonder if an illusion of love would be sufficient enough. maybe it would do the trick, i don't know. sure, it would not be a real connection nor real love, but maybe paying a sex worker to pretend would make some difference. there are things we can't control and things we might. but i honestly think it would not last long.</data>

  <data key="d1">as your story mirrors my own, i can deeply empathize with you. laziness is a shame word used to distract from the underlying issue, be it depression, undealt trauma, or, yes, having to bear a neurological condition that greatly impairs your ability to function in the world. my therapist while your family may not recognize your condition, doctors do. and so does the government see p.s.. but, and most importantly, you do! you are the expert of what you can and can't handle not anyone else! so don't let people especially those who've never experienced, say, a sensoryinduced meltdown at the grocery store tell you how you should feel about your experiences. those experiences are your own, and you have a right to your feelings and gut intuition on what's best for you. you weren't born into an easy existence, but forged through your unique hardships is a psychological or, if you're religious, spiritual depth that few ever reach. those are the people who go on to do great things. however, success does not define your selfworth, you do. so define it through the only metric that matters your wellbeing. we don't get to choose our mountains. but we do get to choose whether or not we climb them. so climb. at least for another day. x200b p.s. if you're in the u.s., there's a great disability aid program you can apply to . i'm currently waiting on a decision fingers crossed! but i know quite a few highfunctioning people who've been accepted.</data>

  <data key="d1">it is a pretty long story, but i guess i could try summing the important parts up in a few sentences. basically i lost my only purpose in life. throughout my life i have tried a lot of stuff and had failed in almost everything, excluding one single thing, that i thought i could live for. the only thing i thought i was good at was science. i went to competitions, won medals which i now realize i really did not deserve and thought that even though i am not good at anything else, that is the thing that i could do that would give me some sense of worth. there was literally nothing else even in the social sense, as i have pretty much given up on getting a girlfriend either, so i just decided that i was destined to be a scientist. when i got into university things started getting a lot harder and i quickly realised i was never good enough at this stuff to begin with. i gave myself a lot of chances, but i now know that i just cannot understand the subjects beyond a certain point. hence, the last thing that gave me any value is gone. i do not provide anything to the world or those around me anymore, and it just makes me miserable. i am a horrible, useless person and therefore i don't see a reason for me to stay alive. i have given up. sorry for wasting your time as well, hope this wasn't too annoying...</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah, when i said science, i was being pretty broad, but what i meant was physics. i really don't think i can do anything else, but i can't do that either. i really have nothing left. i have thought about just leaving school altogether and working some job that doesn't involve any thinking, like being a cleaner or something, but honestly, i don't really see a point in living like that just for myself, for the sake of living. if nothing and no one stops me i'd have no regrets about leaving. if i am the problem, then there is no way of solving it outside of just getting rid of myself</data>

  <data key="d1">in theory yes disappearing wouldnt be the same grief for people. its hard to do i thought about it but kept thinking the not knowing where i went might be just as bad possibly only to find out years and years later. i had a suicidal dream where someone was going to erase my existence for me, no one would ever know and id be dead and in the dream i remember leaving an item where it would be found so people would know that i didnt just vanish. its hard to explain the dream i just at the end didnt want to just vanish cuz there would be no closure for anyone.</data>

  <data key="d1">but is that lack of closure a better option than knowing i killed myself? maybe have some kind of gps tracker and by the time they find my corpse animals will have eaten any evidence of it being a suicide? they could just classify it as an accident and have some closure?</data>

  <data key="d1">it will not be less harmfull if you disappear. they will hope that you still alive and spend some energy to find you and little by little they will fall into despair . the only difference is that the pain will be more spread over time unlike suicide.</data>

  <data key="d1">thats one way to look at it but have you ever thought that maybe the reason no1 tells you about themselves is actually becuase they think it will make you even sadder because maybe the only thing about them is a sad thing but if you really wanted to know about them just ask them most likely they will tell you. also theres always some1 that needs you. the world wouldnt be the same without you</data>

  <data key="d1">failed the first time i tried sending this, so second try. i feel your pain, i feel that sense of, being a terrible person and leeching off others, but you're not a burden. you're in pain, and you're struggling so fucking much, but you're barely grown, and shits hard bro. sometimes you have to rely on others, even though it makes you feel guilty. what's happened in your life isn't your fault. it's shit, it's circumstantial, but somewhere along the line, other people made decisions that left you in a grim spot, and that's not on you. you've got time to sit and play video games and sleep and shit, i do. i'm almost 18 and i do. i haven't left the house in weeks bro, and i feel so guilty about it. but at some point you have to realise that it's not your fault. i can see how hard you're trying,and that means so much you know? a leech wouldn't try either, i know that. i'm sorry if this wasn't at all helpful, i just want you to know it's not your fault and you're not alone, the things that have happened, even if it feel like they are, they're not on you. and you're no burden, you really aren't.</data>

  <data key="d1">i completely understand how you feel. but please don't feel that way about yourself. you can not please everyone. but that also means that there are plenty of people that don't care about the things you see that are bad about yourself. there will be plenty of people who will want you and find you stunning and charming and want you in there lives forever. i understand how you feel. i feel the same way all the time. i think we are the worst to ourselves and thats horrible. there is absolutely nothing wrong with being a virgin either. we all go at our own pace and your time will come. don't view it as a bad thing. you said you've dated someone before, thats already proof that you can and it will happen again. you just have to keep reminding yourself that the bad thoughts you have about yourself are true and you are a catch that is deserving of good things and people. our insecurities ruin our lives if we let them and push away all the good that can happen. i'm 28 and i feel i'm too late to stop them at this point. but thats not true. we can still try. i'm sure you are a beautiful person inside and out and please don't hate on yourself too much, you do not deserve it. you can chat to me anytime if you like send me a message, if not i hope you feel a little better. i feel the same as you and it hurts my heart to here it from someone else.</data>

  <data key="d1">from your response below it seems like you are in the u.s.? i'm in canada so not sure how it all works but insurance if you have it should cover the majority of the medical bills correct? i read that if insurance is not an option then you can try negotiating with the hospital, they will typically lower your bill to a more reasonable amount. 80k for a 3 day hospital stay is complete bs. worst come to worst you can try looking into bankruptcy. i believe bankruptcies will discharge medical bills from what i've heard.</data>

  <data key="d1">yea im in the us and have insurance. they paid a little over 2k towards that. basically said an accident with a brain bleed isnt an emergency. the fact they can argue that is a prime example why this county needs to burn. were fd in every way. both parties are terrible, our government is a joke. theyre just working for corporations and trying to strip our rights away through taxes and debt and dont give af that the price of products is going up while our income drops more and more</data>

  <data key="d1">id say it screws at least 90 of people. even if youre a business owner making half a million a year, 80k in medical debt could kill your business. the only thing is if youre making that much you probably can hire a lawyer to wipe it clean or dramatically reduce it while the guy making 70k or less can probably just argue it and make payments or hope it goes away after 5 or so years. idk what the answer is really. ive been so depressed lately i went to a mental hospital to check in for depression, and they had a 2 week wait. i had to get prior authorization, wait a week to speak to a dr for intake, and now im still waiting for a therapist appointment thursday. then next friday i get to discuss meds with another dr. only way to get in quicker was to sign my rights away to the state, but then id not possibly get approved with insurance. suicide is so much easier than this bs.</data>

  <data key="d1">so he told you he wouldn't be mad... and then got mad anyways? telling your partner that they rely on you too much after they expressed suicidal thoughts doesn't sound like a normal reaction either. him saying that a memory lapse from ptsd was fake and then leaving doesn't sound very caring. i don't want to be insulting, especially since i don't have the full context, but this doesn't sound like a healthy relationship at all. just because he isn't as bad as other people doesn't automatically mean he's good. you deserve better. it sounds like you attach all of your self worth to the relationships you have with other people, and that's not healthy at all. as cliche as it sounds, there is some truth to the statement that you need to love yourself before you can love other people. there's nothing wrong with taking years to get into a relationship, and there's nothing wrong with never getting into a relationship. there's people who haven't found a stable relationship or job in their 30's, and that's perfectly fine. it's normal to feel misunderstood, but i really think there's a great chance that you'll be able to find someone who does understand you. happiness is hard, but if you keep holding on i believe you'll be able to obtain it one day. if you want to talk about things i might not be the best person, but i know a lot of people here are very active in chat. i hope things get better for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">taking something like that is dangerous and the reality of overdosing on any kind of pill is that things can always go the opposite way to how you want them to go and you can be left with disabilities or left in a vegetative state ie a permanent coma forever as a result. i personally would rather die than to be kept in a state like that. i'm not much older than you but honestly, i really do not suggest that you overdose on something like that and even on something like paracetamol or ibuprofen, those things can give you permanent organ damage and you can be left with dialysis or on life support for the rest of your life. that isn't fair for anyone to have to deal with. i'm not going to suggest that things will get better as i do not know that but honestly, do not overdose on any meds like that because the chances of you dying are quite slim and i'm being realistic with that. surely the life that you have right now is better than being in a permanent vegetative state? that is a tragic situation to be in and i wouldn't wish that on anyone. you're so young too at only 14 i have seen so many posts from young kids in this sub and i have only been a member for 24 hours so it just makes me wonder what kind of a world it is that we are living in</data>

  <data key="d1">i was like this. then i had a revalation. if i'm going to die i might as well get absolutely fucked out of my mind on every psychedelic i can get my hands on. one dmt breakthrough later and i'm no longer suicidal. results vary wildly from person to person but dmt is literally what your brain is flooded with when you die. so it's a great alternative if your up for findingvery carefully making some dmt.</data>

  <data key="d1">this world is so cruel, but judging by your post youve known this for quite some time. im sorry that these are the cards that youve been dealt. the fact that you came out the other side of what your childhood was in one piece and alive is incredible. then to put yourself through school and college?!? youre literally the definition of a phoenix. i cant imagine what youre going through and have been through. i know i dont know you at all but please dont give up. there has to be someone or something out there that can help. who knows, maybe in a year or two there will be a break through. i know its easier said than done but you can give up. especially someone with a story like yours. its easy to get pessimistic, especially with your situation but it leads no where. just please get help friend and take care.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey there ash. i'm really sorry to hear you're going throught a tough time. it takes a lot of fortitude and courage to keep going for the people we love, even when we are scared and feel as if we don't belong. your son and husband are very lucky to have you, and i'm sure that they love you very much. i understand the feeling of being a burden, but taking time to heal is important. right now, things might be worse than before, but maybe it's because you haven't found an adequate way to address the source of your negative feelings. i encourgae you to talk to your husband openly about this. not with the intent to burden him, but rather ao that he can understand what you're going through. communication is key, and i think that's an area you might want to improve in. furthermore, you should look into therapy. talking to a professional might help you get a diagnosis and a treatment. i know it's hard, but you've come this far, and you've proven to be strong. i hope things get better. you can come to us anytime for advice, reassurance or just to vent.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm a 44 year old alcoholic. i was doing alright up until age 30. i had a good career in finance, i was in a committed relationship, a condo, car etc. however, my drinking slowly had progressed into addiction. i was drinking a fifth of vodka every day. at work, my performance really suffered. eventually, i lost everything one by one. the job, the car because i got a dui, evicted from my home, and girlfriend left me. ended up in rehab at 35. had to declare personal bankruptcy with 60k in credit debt. my career in finance was over and no company would hire me. too many red flags. i have been bouncing from deadend job to deadend job getting fired along the way because of my drinking or just disinterest ever since. i think about suicide everyday. i am a financial burden on my family since they pay my bills which is the only reason i'm not homeless. my father is ill and will be deadbin the next few years at which point i will jump off a bridge i have already preselected long ago. just don't want to put my dad through that while he is alive. until then i drink alone in a filthy apartment. haven't seen anyone i know in years. haven't worked in years. i don't see the point because i will be dead by 50 i know how you feel.</data>

  <data key="d1">what i have figured out is that everyone is in their own head and they will listen to what they want to believe in. being someone that deals with alot of mental health issues, i had to really dig into my faith and find like minded people. my family and i don't see eye to eye about alot of things and i definitely don't feel like they are on the same mindset as me. so i feel alone alot of times and it puts me in a bad state of mind. i can get really dark in these moments and feel like i want to just cut everyone off. one thing that helps me is finding others that do understand how it is to deal with mental health and talk about it. you are in a good place bringing this up, you are bound to find other people that feel the same.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey you, it's okay to feel broken. you have been through many tough things and lately experienced even more pressure because of those worrying and depressing events. things that many other girls your age probably haven't tried. but that's why you owe yourself immense credit. you got through all these terrible things. you are so strong for being vulnerable and reaching out. you must have such a big heart to care for the people around you that much, wanting to support your mother and not stressing your best friend out. but remember to care for yourself, just as you would for a friend. going back to the clinic would maybe be a good idea, i know that means compromising in other aspects of your life, but you must prioritise yourself. sending you lots of hugs and love</data>

  <data key="d1">your brain is exhausted by all those heavy thoughts but don't trust it! your heart is worth more than anything you could imagine! if you have had good experiences there before, then don't hesitate, call them up and tell them how you feel! don't worry about studies or jobs, you are trying and that is already a big, big step. this just reminded me of something i read in a book recently even though you didn't succeed this time, i am very proud of you. under difficult circumstances you didn't give up. that, to me is a success.</data>

  <data key="d1">correct. right now all girls can go on tinder and meet guys secretly and post nudes and then have mind blowing passionate sex. she will be pounded hard and will enjoy bouncing on another guys big dick. blow jobs, cunninglingus etc will be performed. just remember this, girls like sex too and a lot of it too. i asked a girl once what's it like being a woman and she says she can't wait to be stuffed in her holes. her clitoris is more horny than a guys' penis. she says her pussy was itching and craving for it. then you will be a wageslave earning betabux. don't work too hard in life whatever money you make is yours. don't try to be a good man. i was the guy who put in extra hours to earn more money for my kids.</data>

  <data key="d1">you shouldn't have to endure the pain you're feeling. it sucks feeling like that. it doesn't just suck. it's fucking painful. it really is. have you reached out to anyone for help? hope can only get you so far. we're only one person. we are social beings. we need others to depend on. it's okay to reach out. it puts us in a vulnerable position, sure. but what do we have to lose if we are just going to kill ourselves? there are people out there who genuinely want to help. there may be something out there for you. i've scheduled an appointment for the first time for myself next week. i've thought about all kinds of ways to end my life. i just find little things that keep me going.</data>

  <data key="d1">i empathize. to your point, i really hate it when people get labeled as lazy for wanting a livable wage. i don't mind working at all either, but it becomes an issue when it feels like you're barely keeping your head above water on a week to week basis. and the idea of entitlement? previous generations in the us were able to provide for a family on a single income alone and today we're paying for their social security in their golden years. comes across as slimey when people with that much privilege look down on the newer generations.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know it's an unpopular opinion maybe but i actually think strawberry legs are pretty. just like bruised knees and scars and stuff, it's just another thing that shows our humanity. i have strawberry legs and i used to hate them, but i love them now. i know how it feels to take your hair out and it doesn't come out and want to absolutely go wild with frustration. maybe look and see if there are some products that might work better to set your hair when you're braiding it. i have a certain type of gel i like. also, i'm not gonna tell you oh you're pretty because you're right, i don't know you. i personally believe everyone is pretty in their own way but i digress. my main point is, what is pretty anyway? because imo it's just a societal norm that doesn't matter. your body functions and keeps you alive every single day. your body is serving its purpose. it's a lot of work to live. you don't have to fit into a box of what's pretty or not. you're doing what you need to do. i have hated my body for a long time but i try to look at it with respect. my legs carry me, even if they are not the shape i like! my stomach processes food and nutrition even if i don't like it being bloated! my skin may have acne but it's protecting my internal organs! my body is beautiful! because it keeps me alive! i hope you are able to see the beauty in your body someday too.</data>

  <data key="d1">so like freckels on your legs? thats probably looks cute just because you hate it, majority of people will find it unique and good looking, dont be bothered because of that, we all have stuff that we dont like about ourselfes but just realize that this is the body you have and you should accept it first before liking it. and if theres something that you can fix, try to take one step at the time towards that goal. i found that spiting that fucking downer voice in my head really help. the more it bitches, the more i will tell it to just watch me while i go out for jog or something, just to spite that little shit inside. dont be so hard on yourself, looks do not matter, it does to superficial people, but fuck them, its the inside that counts i know its a cliche but its true. delete instagram, facebook, those social medias are just making you compare yourself to other people and you see only heavily filtered pictures of other people. i hope you will find a strenght to love yourself and your body, i really am rooting for you op, hang in there</data>

  <data key="d1">stop! stop believing the stories your mind keeps telling you. who cares what someone else thinks of you? in this lifetime the only person you will always have to answer to is the one in the mirror. you are writing your own story. if you feel alone, like all of us do, then so be it, be alone with someone you enjoy. you need to start enjoying you! find things that make you happy and who cares what anyone else has to say about it. it's too damn easy to just give up, the hard parts of life are what make the good parts that much better. you will get there, but you need to believe it. you have ppl that care on this site, so vent away, we all get it. we've been there, and some of us are there right now but do not give up hope!</data>

  <data key="d1">this was long statement sorry i over think and im not very good with my emglosh overall so yea yea i've dealt with suicide for a long time, dealing with it was very hard cause every day i keep thinking everyone's gonna die nothing else matters in this world, life has no purpose but suffer everyday of by just existence itself death is the only true freedom for our suffering i kept thinking this way cause of all on what is happening all around the world and people just ignoring it and just keep thinking for themselves. on how i got over it is one day while i was looking through the internet there was a lot of people who are poor, helpless, imprisoned for nothing etc. and i realized that there are a lot of people like this in world especially this time cause of covid and a lot of people dont have the opportunity as i have and my mind clicked on that day that i would make everyone's life a less shithole</data>

  <data key="d1">i was also thinking about the concept named death, though in current times it sounds a very easy word, we hear people dying, suicides, murders etc. but for an individual, that's very sad and horrifying, coz that is it. you stop existing and whatever you have experienced, is just nothing now, the shows you watched, foods you eat, people you met, meaning of all these things gone suddenly. i know i am going extreme existential, but that's just a thought that came to my mind and it kind of made me shiver of the horror of just not existing.</data>

  <data key="d1">maybe a bit weird to ask this under a post from someone else, but how did you manage to explain others how you really feel? i've been tired of live for some years now and before was suicidal for a time, and told my friends about it with the intention that they know why i would have killed myself if it's gonna happen. by now they are so used to the fact that i am tired of live and accepted it, what i appreciate, but also makes it hard for me to talk with them when i need to talk with somebody. it makes me feel like they can't relate or understand when i'm feeling worse and that it would help me to talk. i'm also very afraid that they will just think that i want more attention and i'm not in a worse mental state than the other days. i really would love to have someone i know as a person who i can go to and talk but i'm just to afraid to get started. if you have any advise you or someone else could give me from personal experience, i'd really appreciate it. also sorry for my maybe bad english.</data>

  <data key="d1">op, i had the same plan as you. ended up calling a hotline instead and went into the hospital. i remember playing nes in the hospital with other residents. now i have a 7year old son who plays mario with me. i'm sorry that your life is a living hell right now, friend. it may never get better. but if you are certain it will never get better, don't listen to that bullshit. anyone who has had a surprise birthday party knows that life can be unexpected. rooting for you, op.</data>

  <data key="d1">how come you got banned? okay man, well the way i see it. there's 2 options but to me they both sound pretty rough... 1. i can reach out to him if you want. sounds crazy but if it helps. it helps. telling this guy you love him and shooting your shot might not necessarily go the way you want it to and if he doesn't reciprocates those same feelings then where does that leave you? 2. because of that risk of rejection and it not panning out the way i think you're hoping... the second option is to ride this out. this sucks way more but in the long term it is probably the healthier option mentally. bare in mind there maybe more to this than i know.</data>

  <data key="d1">if i were you i would check the symptoms of depression online and see if you have that. you can do online self tests. if that is the case then you can ask your gp for ssri's but before that i would try and overcome it naturally. you can search for ways of doing so online. if you don't have depression and you think of suicide then maybe reading some philosophy can help. why do you think you want to die? maybe you feel lonely? do you have a girlfriend and if not do you think that love might help you? are you overstressed with school? writing it down can help.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah. the majority of people don't care because they can't relate. every time i open up to someone i end up getting ridiculed or mocked, or worse, i get the good ole you need therapy bro. suicidal thoughts have tainted my thought process. i often find myself daydreaming about killing myself violently either by jumping in front of a train or shooting myself between the eyes, and it gets really scary sometimes when i get lost in these thoughts. venting here or on other social media platforms is pointless as well since no one cares or listens forcing my suicidal thoughts to turn inwardly. luckily for me i never had any friends to begin with, so my depression didn't drive anyone away however, it created a force field around me that keeps people away.</data>

  <data key="d1">most people don't really care. it's difficult finding people who do, but i think people on this forum have more sympathy than the average person. it's difficult helping someone in our position to be honest, i mean think about it. most of us here have depression and have at least toyed with the idea of suicide, and while i wish i could help everyone here, sometimes an individual's situation seems so foreign that any words you may have to try and cheer that person up may seem hollow. do not however mistake that for apathy however. just because i or others don't write anything doesn't mean we don't care, it's just that sometimes it's difficult to find the words to try and help someone in a different situation than your experiences have taught you. again i'm not sure there's much i can do for you or anyone else, pathetic as i am, but i sincerely care for all the troubled people who feel they have no one and nowhere else to confide in other than in this place. i hope you'll be ok, good luck.</data>

  <data key="d1">when she's hurting you it's a form of clipping your wings so to say. she struggles to find her own fleeting power and she's using you as a device to elevate yourself. you first need to breathe, concentrate, and ignore. i understand its hard but you can't allow her words to register on an emotional level. if they do she wins, the greatest way you can win against her is to meet her hate with silence.</data>

  <data key="d1">my best advice to this is to do research in how you can budget your money effectively. host a carboot sale and sell unwanted things, and maybe this could ease the load off for a while, while you sort out some other things. do some research on whether you can apply for grants and benefits and apply for them, i would also suggest talking your feelings out with someone as an outlet so it doesn't build up inside. i understand this is all a bit much to deal with mentally and it can seem daunting but just take life one step at a time, there's no need to run. try loading on canned foods maybe for a while until you have enough saved to live comfortably for a while until your mental health gets better</data>

  <data key="d1">im really sorry for what you are going through and im sorry that you are lonely. you seem like a very nice person but the problem is that a lot of mentally ill people liked to be left alone and it suits them. you should go out to places you like now and try and meet people there. or when school starts again join a club and meet people that way.</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah i like chess too quite a bit although i would say i am far from good at it. in high school i was in a play helping with props and even that was pretty fun. if i ended up having a good time with moving props around between scenes i am sure you can find a way to enjoy playing a role that doesn't require too much skill.</data>

  <data key="d1">i looked through your post history and i am here to just say i am sorry. it looks like you have been going through hell for the last few months. i have also had really shitty 2020 too even though not on your level, i find the thing that gets me through tough times is my purpose and my spiritual life. yeah sounds dumb and selfhelpy and it doesn't put food on the table and its hard to focus on when the bills are coming in but if life doesn't have a deeper meaning than what the hell am i here for? just to eat, procreate and pay bills into a society? there are thousands of issues to help with in the world. from going on forums like this and helping when you can to volunteer work. x200b that is my experience. i am sorry if that wasn't useful. good luck</data>

  <data key="d1">mucho gusto miss mouse, we have never talked or even met before, so forgive me for commenting to you out of the blue like we are familiar with each other. however, it's hard for me to not do so simply because i have been following your story for years before i finally even signed up for this site. i just wanted to express how much i hope you're still in this world with us, seeing as there is an obviously extreme shortage of nonshitty people here. i for one would be severely disappointed and saddened if that was to not be the case. from my experience, it seems like only evil narcists like your exmil are allowed to live so long, but it's my sincere hope that miss rona will change the trajectory of such injustice. you don't know this, but you changed my life miss mouse. you changed it for the better with these words from a post of yours i stumbled upon years ago. it reads as follows there's no strength in standing by an abusive so. only pain.your so hits you? leave. he is verbally or emotionally abusive? leave. he exposes you to abusive people. leave. if you find yourself covering for your sos behavior? leave. if you find yourself hiding major parts of your relationship from friends and family? leave. he has an addictionmental health disorde an orphan who lived on grass and water, but his behavior is too much for you? leave. if you need permission, this is it. get out sooner rather than later. the longer you stay, the worse it gets. anonymousmousegirl this...this right here. this part of that post you made so long ago was the final straw that finally opened my eyes. that changed things...forever. that saved me and no telling how many others from going through the worst of what you went through. listen, i don't care what anyone else says because my mind will never change on this...you're a fucking hero, op. at least to me. and it will be a damn shame and injustice if someone with so much heart and wisdom like you were to leave this world so soon...a world that is in desperate need of symbols like yourself of truly good and brave people for others like me to look up to and learn from. and by the way, my apologies for going off subject to geek out a little, but i am a huge fan of fallout 4. truly one of my favorite games ever. however, if you haven't got the chance to play the newer fallout 76 version, i can assure you from personal experience that you didn't miss much if anything at all. i wasted a good chunk of change on it and then proceeded to waste of month of life before i was bored to tears. ah well, just thought i would give you that tidbit of info, it's the least i could do. please take care and stay safe. i wish you all the best and hope you'll soon find the stable happiness that you deserve and been deprived of for far too long.</data>

  <data key="d1">think of it like this, we were blinked into existence forcefully and now we are just unblinking ourselves out by our own consent. we never consented to being blinked in to begin with. the brilliance of rick and morty mr.meseeks existence. it's the same as our existence, we were born to die. some live longer and some end short. perhaps by artificially increasing the human life span we have gone against the natural order of things. therefore disease, depression, etc are the consequence of doing so. humans live for far too long and breed too many.</data>

  <data key="d1">orrrrrrr when you know how it feels to feel all of those things, you become a healer of yourself, first, and then others. you show them the light inside themselves by reflecting it from your heart. people say you must first love yourself before you can love someone else and i'm calling bullshit on that! love isn't something you learn or earn. it's not something you need to bargain or trade. it's something we are all born for, innately ingrained in our dna. sometimes, the ones who love the hardest and most are the ones who understand what it feels like to lack love! love is completely free. love with expectation of something in return is not love but a business transaction. i love you, fellow human if people can hate for no reason at all then we can love without reason too.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's hard to love yourself when no one has shown you love but i bet there are people that you love anyway, right? sometimes, i think we are here to show others the love that we have to give and that they're worthy of the love they never received. and that sometimes facilitates healing in them and also us and our capability to love ourselves more too. i love you, as a person who is deeply wounded, that desires love but doesn't know how to receive it. i love you as a human being that is deserving and worthy</data>

  <data key="d1">is sitting down with them around the table or whatever an option? explain to them how you feel, that this is who you are and you'd appreciate their support and acceptance. as a parent i catch myself falling into reactive responses. make them consider your thoughts, listen to and consider their thoughts. it doesn't mean you have to agree with any of it. remind them ultimately you are who you are and no matter how much they may bristle against your self awareness it won't change anything.</data>

  <data key="d1">rejection is hard and letting go of things is harder in my experience. do you have people in your life that are often wronging you? if it's hard to let go of things like that, a good first step would be surrounding yourself with people who make you think of bad things like that.</data>

  <data key="d1">i remember the first time i was rejected, that was literally the only thing i thought about for 5 months straight. i wanted revenge, i wanted to hurt the other person, i wanted to hurt myself in order to try and hurt them. after several more rejections i came to the conclusion that if they dont want me then fuck them they dont deserve me. honestly the best way to get back at them imho is to move on and keep trying to date. if you find someone you like post pic of yourself with that person, show them you can be happy without them.</data>

  <data key="d1">holy fuck reading the first half of that was like reading my own thoughts. i obsess and obsess over the thought of hurting myself to get back at them, or hurting them mentally or physically. i know its not the right thing to think about but i just cant bring myself out of it once i was talking to someone romantically over snapchat seeing if a relationship would fit, and after a week and a half one morning i woke up and they blocked me. i spammed their different social media accounts asking why and telling them what a shitty person they are for doing that. sometimes i still think about trying to contact them again. i treated them with such affection and praise every single day</data>

  <data key="d1">if that person gave up on you that easily, would it have been better if they did it now or later when you were several magnitudes more romantically invested in him? honestly dating is a numbers game. you need to filter through so much bullshit before you find what you are looking for. i bet you there is someone out there in the same exact position as you. in fact there are thousands of individuals that are in the same spot as you. and they all want to be with you but you need to find them. how can you connect with them?</data>

  <data key="d1">aye men, i was diagnosed with bd 6 years ago , i wanted to do the saqme since i just couldnt handle almost stabbing my loved ones , but i soon realised that its what it is and it'll never go . and that was 5th of december 2015 i was 13 back then, today is 23rd of sept and im still alive , not a murder , a free man with a free will and a smile on the face . i dont know your age , but you have a long life to live , regardless of your age . a mental disorder may be a issue but its not a bad thing that you need to die over . its hard , but i can tell you that by acceptence , youll realise that you can use your illness to your own advantage . take my suggestion my guy , you wont regret it</data>

  <data key="d1">shame and embarrassment? dude you are asking for help! there is nothing more prideful and glorious! do you think anybody or anyone could manage everything all the time by themselves? it comes from a strong character that you ask for help and from your humanity that you need it! nothing shameful in that! and let me saywrite?something else instead you are completely right the world is to big and to weird and surprising that nothing would help! you would be unique if nothing would help and as much we all which that we are unique with nearly 8billion people on earth thats pretty unlikely! and last but not least you tried to check yourself in and chickend out? most people don't even go there and before you would put your life on the line you have to think about it if you think you want to end it you would have nothing to lose so you could go there without any fear or any kind of risk becausewhat's the worst that would happen at the check in? loss of your personal data? i don't think you are an embarrassment or a shame or god beware somebody who should drop the curtain! i think you are in a dark spot and you are thinking about getting out of that spot and your mind stumbled over suicide and an extremely dumb part of you thought yeah that could work! and a way more intelligent part of you went to the check in and wrote that massage here on this board! i think the later one is the one worth listening to!</data>

  <data key="d1">i get it, i've been where you are in similar circumstances, minus the pandemic. i felt exhausted by the thought of slogging my way through 4.5 years of university i changed majors too, having to find a job and grind for the next 40 years, and then withering into old age. the idea of ending it seemed infinitely preferable to slowly burning myself out over the course of decades, only to eventually die anyways. i came very close to killing myself, numerous times. but i decided to just take it one day at a time and not give a fuck about the little things, because if they wouldn't matter if i was dead, they shouldn't matter when i'm alive. i'm glad i took this approach, as i've had some great and lifechanging experiences since then, despite having some terrible ones too. maybe i will eventually die by suicide one day, maybe it'll all become too much, too tiring for me. but whether it's tomorrow, or at 40 years old, or 70, etc. i'll know i gave it a good try, and had some happy moments amidst all the dark.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's okay. yeah, we have something called matura, it's just bunch of exams you have when you're in your last year in high school, actually we're even out of highschool when they are because graduation is always before. you have to write basic polish, basic math and basic language other than polish and one extended exam you choose, you can write more than one extended and most people write 23. you actually choose a class in high school before entering with extended program of learning some of the subjects. there is biology, chemistry and math one for example and they are teaching you these 3 on extended level. when you want to apply to university every major has table of what subject counts there and how many points you get for basic level, extended level and other version of matura which i'm not able to translate but it gives you the most points. you can write extended level without going to class with special program for it but it's harder because you have to do everything by yourself. it sucks especially when you have depression and think you're not going to make it to 18, so you don't even try. but many people without depression have this struggle too. this system is messed up and doesn't work anymore.</data>

  <data key="d1">i know it doesnt make too much sense, but i feel like at least trying to od would help prove to myself that im depressedsuicidal and might lead me to actually get help later. i always refuse help because i dont think ive reached a low enough point. part of me also knows that at the point im at right now i wouldnt be able to follow through with an actual suicide plus i dont have any means to, and i know if i were actually heavily suicidal id probably find a way. so taking a shit ton of antidepressants at the current moment would mean that id be less likely to get any in the future, and might mean id get myself to a point where i can actually try harder next time and might succeed. getting hospitalized after a failed attempt would also serve as a legitimate excuse to my school as to why i havent been doing well in classes, which contributes to the majority of my stress. i realize the logic is all over the place lol</data>

  <data key="d1">pain matters. it's remembered by others. it doesn't matter if you don't remember it, others will. same goes for joy. even though you will die and not remember it, it matters in this moment. moments in the present matter. why? because for this moment you exist, you feel, that is a real feeling, others feel, it's a real feeling. a moment can last forever and on a universal scale, that feeling is everything. spend time doing anything you enjoy and remember that moment and feeling. if you ever find yourself just happy even just for 5 minutes, remember it and seek it. don't do drugs, they only make it harder to ever find joy in anything.</data>

  <data key="d1">could be a multitude of reasons. they may have had someone they know commit suicide which left them emotionally scarred. they could be guilt tripping because they don't know any better way to convince someone not to do it. or they can just have a poor understanding of what being suicidal is about</data>

  <data key="d1">suicide does end up hurting the people around you. losing someone you love, or even someone you just know well to suicide is pretty devastating. at the same time, people who don't experience the intense emotional pain suicidal folks usually do really struggle to understand just how much suffering we are in. it's a level of pain most people never experience, or only experience a few times in their life, perhaps the death of a parent or child, or a divorce. so, you have people who can immediately see and understand the pain we'd cause by ending our lives, but can't see or understand the pain we are in. i think that often leads people to a place of confusion and anger.</data>

  <data key="d1">you are not stupid. do you ever panic, or shutdown during tests? anxiety is real and can impact your ability to learn or do well on tests which you mostly mentioned, or in school academically in general. unfortunately, due to societys expectations, we have this idea we have to achieve 100, or a perfect score, to show were smart. pay attention to progress. not necessarily the score on your test. keep eating playing games. make a little time to study, get adequate sleep. good luck!</data>

  <data key="d1">i have friends on the spectrum and so i've seen and learned about some of the battles of it. with that said it's wait makes you who you are so it is terminal, but that's not a bad thing. you will be this way from when you are born till you die and so it's a part of you to love and accept. i can never understand what you are going through fully but i can tell you that being left out when everyone else is in a couple can be devastating. my freshman year of college or uni as you guys say everyone of my close friends was coupled up and it sucked. but it led me to meeting new people who i am friends with to this day. now i'm not saying that the same will happen for you, but i am saying that it might and imo that's worth testing.</data>

  <data key="d1">having those same frustrations recently. ive just completely stopped talking to my friends about anything now because of it. im sorry theyre like that. sometimes people just say what they know based on their own experiences. they may or may not know the intensity of your feelings situation, but they wanna help somehow so theyre just saying whatever comes to mind that may help which of course doesnt. rooting for you. x</data>

  <data key="d1">it sure sucks to do it all alone. it sucks even more when you know you dont have to and you truly make the effort to reach out, but theyre not really making the efforts back to try and understand you, your feelings experiences. it hurts a lot to know you do want help, you do want to talk and get better even, but they give you nothing to work with. i wish i had the answers for the both of us, really. im tired of going about the days alone, too.</data>

  <data key="d1">it comes from this culture of if you need help, reach out but no part of that tells anyone what to do if someone does reach out for help. theres this assumption that every depressedsuicidal person hasnt ever talked about their problems, and talking about problems is the first step to solving them. but if youve done the first step of reaching out multiple times you start to realize thats all there is. there arent any resources besides someone to listen which just isnt very useful unless your main problem is not having someone to talk to, and thats very rarely someones main problem.</data>

  <data key="d1">im roman catholic, for reference. i can definitely understand anger towards god. in when i was 20, my mother passed away from cancer. when i was 21, my father passed from heart failure. i had been homeless for a year after my mothers passing. believe me, i know how feeling angry towards god can feel. youre angry at a being that you have no control over, but has total control over your life. whatever your beliefs are, know that whatever you are going through, you are stronger than those obstacles. and thats not me speaking on religion. thats me speaking on your own strength. you can and will overcome all the bs in your life. if i can pull myself out of poverty, you can overcome anything.</data>

  <data key="d1">there is a god. he is the creator, he exists whether we believe in him or not. before anyone discovered gravity did it exist? adam and eve brought sin into the world so we suffer, but there is hope. god always demanded a blood sacrifice for sin, which was why he accepted abel's sacrifice of an animal and not cain's of produce, hence cain's rage. even then god did not kill cain, i think because god had yet said that murder was sin. however of course cain had a conscience he knew it was bad. my point is perhaps you suffer for the sins of others, but you can persevere with the help of jesus you can go on in this life if you are saved this world is not your home. jesus is god. ' i and the father are one'' god is three in one. you don't have to understand it for now, just have faith. jesus became the perfect sinless sacrifice for sin. no man took his life from him, he said he laid it down.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey kid, as a college student, i have the same fear about the future. i dont want ti study and get a shitty job just to fucking live. the world sucks. but i'm sure there's some part of you longing for the freedom of adulthood and independence. you'll get to live alone and do the things you love. what do you like? any movie, music game?</data>

  <data key="d1">hey i do happen to like music production. tho idk that much about it either. do you have a daw?? you can keep trying to learn more. there's so many inspiring and helpful yt vids out there. if you want suggestions, ask away also what genres do you like?? ik this won't solve your life problems but if it keeps you happy for a while even, it's worth doing.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm also having my own thoughts about ending it right now, but i'm not here to encourage you to do that. i relate to your issues with alcoholism in the family, and one way that i've been able to help myself is trying to become financially independent from my dad who also has issues with being an abusive alcoholic. i've lived in pretty extreme poverty the last few years and worked some really shitty jobs, which creates its own kind of stress. but it did give me a chance to, for better or worse, not let him affect me which creating distance will do. if you have a healthy, loving relationship with your siblings or anyone else, don't give up on them. that's the difference between us from what i can tell. try to take back your life by getting away from him because alcoholics won't change when you appeal to them with reason. my dad seems to have gotten better but i think it's because i and my other siblings pretty much stopped talking to him for years. might work, might not, but it did for me. i know it's depressing out there especially in the jobs market, but love really does make life worth living so if your siblings really love you and treat you right, try to keep going. good luck</data>

  <data key="d1">ok, but hear me out. whenever i first got into astrology it was because my search history and journals and everything always was falling apart in the same ways at the same time, but then i started noticing patterns in times of the yeaevents. im not going to blame everything on the stars, but it did make me feel empowered to be able to have some sense of control because i could see things coming as tests and if i failed the test i knew another would come and id be better prepared. four years isnt very long. if people are asking if youre okwere you? its not time to give up.</data>

  <data key="d1">it might be possible that they have issues with your friend group, such as feeling out of place. i dont know the entire situation but maybe they do want the distance right now. you can try talking to them but be careful of prying too much and trying to fix them, it will look like you want to make yourself look good. as for you op, maybe try calling a crisis line so you have someone to support you emotionally.</data>

  <data key="d1">is your physical health good at least? if yes then maybe you can look into a coding bootcamp or some field that lets you pay once you get a job. college isn't as great as it used to be, developing skills is where it is at and developing your network. anyway, i've wasted most of my highschool years and early 20s because of inaction and not knowing what the heck i wanted to do. if you have a friend or family member to move in with and get a part time job and develop a portfolio to showcase skills then this could be a solution for you i hope.</data>

  <data key="d1">there are some chat and textbased hotlines we include the reputable ones we know about in our hotline list if that would be more comfortable for you. if you were looking for an informal chatroom, it turns out to be next to impossible to keep suiciderelated chatrooms safe and supportive, much harder than a subreddit we had to stop allowing people to advertise those here after too many reports of bad experiences. of course you're welcome to talk with us, too we can't respond in realtime but we do want to be here and talk however we can.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi there i'm sorry you're feeling this way. i'm not as paranoid as you are but i can really relate to fainting with needles and not trusting most mental health profesionals. it's really hard for me to open up with someone and i don't like the approach of being looked down upon as crazy or an impossible case. i also understand the being dead part. it's so comforting to finally not having to face your failures and drift to peaceful oblivion. but here's the thing, we're gonna die eventually. so we might as well try to live for the heck of it. trying to improve yourself so when you die you feel more satisfied with yourself than you currently are feeling now. feeling like a dissapointment is not a permanent feeling or badge, you can change it and become a notdissapointment in your eyes. to the being mourned, there's a better alieve version which is being appreciated. we all have the need to be acknowledged and celebrated for who we are. unfortunatley this need is not always met by our family or close social circles so you might benefit from making new connections who both appreciate you and understand you. reddit is a good place to start for example to the being a robot or like a robot, that's ok and totally valid. you're not defective or wrong. same way there's people who lean more heavily in the emotional aspect, there are others who are more practical and logical. do what works for you. some people like me want to be surrounded by people the majority of the day while others only tolerate hanging out with others once a month. one isn't better than the other, just different. you might even use these traits to help you get ahead in whatever profesion you want to make a living out of. you might not be as distracted by other people and will not engage with others without finishing your current assignment, making you finish quicker and being more efficient. you might be comforted by a specific routine in a job while others might find it a monotonaus hell. so embrace your differences and play them up to your advantage.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey there. you sound like a thoughtful individual. thinking of your loved ones is the right thing to do. dont do it! you probably just need to make a change. i remember being 23, i hated my life then too. i worked as a laundry attendant in the basement of a hotel resort in our town. i cant even begin to tell you how much pain i was in. i had so much anxiety from having my first panic attack the year prior. so much anxiety. crippling. and i had no friends. but, i worked through it. if you dont have a job i would recommend getting one. it would give you something to do. that is very helpful if you feel this way. there is so much out there for you, dont end your life! its not over. god loves you. dont do it! i would love to see argentina. i come from the states. maybe some day. my brother took his life last year and i miss him very much. dont do it.</data>

  <data key="d1">it is very painful to lose him because i lost someone who i loved unconditionally. he was always there for me as a brother and he knew me, and i always knew who he was. you take this for granted if youve never lost someone like that close to you but these people are special because they have been there your whole life. so special was he. a real brother.</data>

  <data key="d1">this type of lecturing never helps the situation, it just makes the person feel worthless even more. only living for your loved ones isn't enough, op needs to find a reason to want to keep living. i sincerely hope they do find a way out of this, guilt tripping isn't the answer.</data>

  <data key="d1">i was also the suprise child. my parents had my sister immediately after as i was born because of some logical choice to have each developmental stage closer together. we ended up being irish twins and as girls develop maturity faster i was never allowed to be a big brother. she could get away with anything while i was blamed for some of what she did. i had tons of trouble in school and eventually joined the military. my sister went to college where my parents paid her way through school on the other side of the country.bought her a new car and everything i feel your frustration not being considered the bread winner of the family.</data>

  <data key="d1">people really only know what you show them and tell them, some people think about this sort of stuff and wouldn't know what to do, as we grow we learn what to do, what to feel, and what to say, it only comes with experience, your friends may not know what to say, they care about you but unless they've dealt with suicide before it's going to be really hard for them to cope. speak to a teacher, yes a teacher, if anyone also understands adolescent depression, it's gonna be the happiest go lucky teacher you have at your school. some teachers have watched other students fall into a depression and commit suicide before, and if anyone is really trying to get to you emotionally, it's the teacher who is always cracking a joke. even if you don't understand it. there might be some age differences, absolutely, but people who have gotten to the point where they want to deal with raging hormonal teens until they see them at the bank or on the way to work at a cafe want to help, some don't do it well, some even fall into depression themselves and put it out on students, those teachers should be given a vacation... until they find a new school.</data>

  <data key="d1">now, if you decide to tell your friends, ask them about the topic beforehand and gauge their reaction, if it doesn't seem they'll handle it well it might be better to ask someone else, avoid dramatic people when it comes to these problems, they'll stress you out a bit more.</data>

  <data key="d1">the issue as an outsider looking in, i can't understand your perspective. and this isn't a bad thing. please allow me to explain myself. i don't know you, but i know you are a human. in that regard there are shared experiences among us all. meaning, that if i feel joy or pain or laughter. they all come from the same wellspring we all share as humans. so i know we are capable of the same emotions, but the circumstances of our lives will take us different places, and thus feel certain emotions more than others. i don't know the circumstances of your life that cause you constant pain. i know pain as well, but it's not a daily occurrence for me. so i don't understand how you ended up at your current perspective. we all have totally different upbringings and thus experiences and reactions to what goes on in our lives. it makes me sad when i read that there are people who've somehow been backed into a corner by life to the point they want to die. you are deserving of help, you are a human being.</data>

  <data key="d1">your writing style is very decent though. sorry to be brief in my reply, but personally, i prefer to iterate and find what actually works. it's still as painful. but somehow there are more options, and you find that far more people in this together. communities might help those less assuming. not taking it too seriously sometimes help so people can bear the intensity.</data>

  <data key="d1">i got out of the military when i was 22. there was no way i could go to therapy and they wouldn't know about it. after i got into my university, i felt it was safer to talk with someone. i went to the university counseling center, the psychiatrist there was amazed at some of my life stories. she was a ph.d. student then, so she referred me to her professor. it was mostly me talking about my past and how i felt, which honestly wasn't that bad. after 4 sessions or so, i didn't see any improvements. i was begging to get scared that it might somehow blowback on my records. maybe i shouldn't have left the therapy, but at the time i couldn't trust anybody. even now i have trust issues. there are some personal issues that i am not comfortable with sharing online. i don't want to blame anybody, but no one around me can or wants to help me.</data>

  <data key="d1">actually, i can. i am studying for my master's at the same university. i just doubt it would help me much. plus there is the issue of trust too. i could never fully trust them to not report me to the university for being suicidal. another reason is that i never thought they could help anyone. during those 4 sessions, i made a new friend. he was the time after me, we would talk about normal stuff like we weren't there for counseling. he didn't quit like me, he kept going to those sessions, then covid happened. he kept going, but after his father died he has become so isolated that even i couldn't talk to him. he went for at least 2 years.</data>

  <data key="d1">you really remind me of myself in many ways. i mean i don't actually know much at all but at least from your comments what your struggling with sounds familiar. i'm not going to say not to kill yourself but it would be pleased it if you didn't. i am going to give you what i came here for reasons. it sounds like your situation sucks but it might not allways suck. sometimes things improve, change, fluctuate, sometimes get worse too. but change in some form is nearly inevitable and there's something in this world that i bet you would consider worth living for, find that thing. family sucks, trust me i know. but that can't stop you from finding people who don't suck. you might not know them now but they do exist. i'm not sure why your therapist isn't taking your cbt suggestion but that clearly means you haven't tried all the options. there might be one that works! and even if there isn't some people find philosophy can help but i don't remember that as a first option since it's not the best option and not allways helpful. point is there's a good chance something out there could help. last but not least i want to thank you. it might sound dumb but reading what you wrote helped me. i'm not the only one who feels this way and i can still do somethings worth living for even if they might feel few and far between right now. i forgot that.</data>

  <data key="d1">im 27 and i 100 agree. i attempted in the past and have struggled with suicidal ideation for years, but a big thing that got me through it all was this idea that i still had time left of my twenties to turn things around. that i still had youth on my side, and that it was ok to be making mistakes and not have my shit together. the possibility of a happier future kept me going, even when it felt like a slim possibility. at 27 i feel like all that has changed. all of a sudden people around me have their shit figured out, or know what they want in life and are making moves to get it. it makes being a suicidal person questioning the point of even being here much more lonely, because i feel like fewer and fewer people around me can relate now. a big area being 27 has impacted is dating. my looks and youth are in decline from here on out now, and dating requires knowing how you feel about marriage, kids, life goals etc. because people from this age onwards tend to look more seriously for something long term, and dont want to date someone unstable or unsure of their future andor questioning the point of existence. in your early twenties dating is more about love stories than life partners. the fact is that someone suicidal like me who doesnt know what would even make them happy in life just isnt great life partner material. thus perpetuating the suicidal thoughts, and the cycle continues ... its a transitional age to shit getting real. i dont blame people for opting out around now and i myself basically have a plan on the back burner to kill myself before turning 28 so i dont have to deal with things only getting worse for me from here on out.</data>

  <data key="d1">hi, another nonenglish speaker here having a hell of a night to go through. your words sound like a familiar echo to me, some differences here and there but it feels like i could have written this post myself. first of all your childhood doesn't sound idyllic to be honest, even if at the time it didn't feel like shit, it does affect people later in life...maybe with an insecure attachment towards friends and relationships in general. your progression to depression sound familiar too, in my case there was a, at the time undiagnosed, fisical medical condition fuelling it, but for everyone can be different. i really understood that family, my mother in my caseit's just the 2 of us, doesn't necessarily have your back from a young age. in my case finding a job helped, even if sometimes i'm so tight and stressed out that i'll have panic attacks on my way to work or at the supermarkets. it gives me some vague taste of satisfaction. the idea of taking my own life puts a smile on my face too but i'm too scared and, probably, non truly convinced of it. hope you get better soon</data>

  <data key="d1">you sound like you're only young and not living independently yet. you also sound like you need to get rid of the boyfriend! perhaps spend some time alone, just working on you. do you work? study? school? what hobbies do you have? it's time to get out and meet folks! try different things. different foods. to me, it sounds like typical youth angst about parents. yours sound like they just care about you. it's sweet. don't be too harsh on them. when your mood is all over the place, all they can do is ride it out. things get better. these years are for growing and learning, for falling and failing and trying again. just keep going and one day all this bullshit will have passed..... sort of. hugs from afar!</data>

  <data key="d1">wanting people to show they care about you is vital, we crave connection as humans. your feelings are valid and true. i just hope you know its okay to reach out to people and say you need support too! killing yourself wont allow you the chance to connect to these people you care about ya know? wishing you nothing but a positive journey ahead, you do deserve it</data>

  <data key="d1">hi there. i know exactly how you feel when you say that you should deal with your problems alone. but reach out. talk to people and seek help. by seeking help doesnt mean that we are weak. it takes strength to seek help. in seeking help you are being strong. there is no shame in it at all. please give yourself that chance. things will get better..</data>

  <data key="d1">i understand that you want to help me. encourage myself to keep moving forward. but i find it hard in myself to see why it would be worth it for me to keep going. i wanted to become a nurse to help others aid others or in general to be liked by those around me. i often daydream about myself what i can achieve and how great my life can be. but when i look at myself at the moment i come to my sense and realize i wont achieve it. i feel like giving myself a chance would only end up in disappointment. thx for commenting tho it made the night better by having one one to talk too.</data>

  <data key="d1">i understand how you want to help by recommending therapy and bring up how expectations lead to where my state of mind is right now but, im expected to be the best out of the family. coming out of a family who worked hard to give me opportunities they never had. made sure i didnt have to face struggles so i wouldnt know what it was like for them. to become a man who everyone can be proud of to be associated with them. im scared to disappoint with what i am now and what ill be in the future. so thats why i want to just disappear and end it. thx for talking to me. it felt like i had a friend who i could tell my true feeling about myself toward goodbye</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm glad i could help even just a little. have you thought of doing some voluntary work? something in the same kind of field as medical or care? i have a lot of friends who became vaxers as their employment dried up i am certain you could become a nurse if you wanted to. volunteering will help boost your confidence and also could go on your resume. i had a friend . he was kinda lost and didn't know what to do. so he started training as a nurse. he did really well. so well in fact that his tutors transfered him to another course to become a doctor. which he is now. we limit ourselves too much. it sounds like you need a big confidence boost in yourself. .. hugs...</data>

  <data key="d1">hello, thanks for this. now that i think about it, i think my situation will improve, yes, but after spiralling down and delaying them for so long i don't think i'll even be given a chance to make it right...i'm actually trying to message my prof right now and just...prepare myself for verdict, i guess. as for work, it's a lot, and i just don't see myself meeting the deadlines because i've lost focus and it feels like everything is crashing and burning at the same time. it's been this way for the past two years, i think. uni sucks and sometimes i want to whack people for giving students tons of shit to do for the sake of giving them, but i also want to be like everyone else who just...get things done, you know? what kills me is that as much as i want to throw in the towel...i really just want to get it done and be unstuck</data>

  <data key="d1">like the idea of the youtube videos. if it turns out that drawing is not your thing, just the fact that you've shown this determination and dedication to it shows you have right there what it takes to be very good at something, and maybe it's not drawing. from what i've seen in life, the people who have landed on their feet are the ones who have that dedication, put in the work, the energy. as far as invalidation of your feelings because you aren't dealing with the same issues as some are, it doesn't work that way unfortunately. even the small stuff can feel enormous to us at times, and can completely drag us down. and we're less likely to seek help for it, as we write it off as self pity or whatever. but we still can use the help. it's possible something else is going on with you and it's just coming out in this way, like other pressures you have that maybe you're not really conscious of or thinking as much about. there is plenty of stress going on right now. do you happen to see anyone like a therapist to let some of this out to?</data>

  <data key="d1">you actually can draw you 'just' can't draw like the people who get praised for their drawings. you know what's funny? people try to make replicas of famous paintings. even vincent van gogh could not create an exact copy of his own painting. there's always some minor stroke that's different than the original. feck perfuction, embrace your apparently not so great drawings. this world needs more authentic stuff and less perfection.</data>

  <data key="d1">the mental pressure can factor into the severe burnout you are experiencing. i'm so sorry to hear that you haven't been able to see the sky in the dark hole but know that this part of your life doesn't have to reflect what's coming next. you've failed, that's okay. what are you going to do with that situation? it's easier said than done but come clean and evaluate your options with someone you trust, it can be a good way to see your problem from an outside perspective. can you appeal to your school to reduce the effects of your nonattendance, missed work.. etc? remember that while succeeding can be a good goal in life, it can look very different, it doesn't have to be a smooth path. you are not less or inherently worse for going through it.</data>

  <data key="d1">tried talkin about this with a close friend of mine and they made me feel a little bit better but still the thought of just leaving is still inside my head. i've tried appealing and they gave me one more chance but it got shot down when my mom messaged my teachers that she doesn't care if i fail anymore and if they wanted to fail me then she's ok with it. and thank you for this, it helped me see things in a different perspective. i'll try my best.</data>

  <data key="d1">i mean, it will take time to come down from that state. it's not easy. just keep on doing what works to make your situation easier and seem more manageble. it's good that you've got the support of your friend. it can be priceless at times like these. is there any chance that you could intervene? i think that's something more up to the student than the parent to decide, no?</data>

  <data key="d1">selfharm is a coping mechanism that can be ultimately selfdefeating. often the relief comes during the time you inflict the pain. your brain does release endorphins as a response a factor on why it feels good but that doesn't last long and then you might feel overcome with guilt. there are other ways you can cope with emotional pain. what have you tried and did or didn't work? are you open to exploring more methods to cope with the emotional turmoil that doesn't involve harming yourself? it would help to know the cause of why you are feeling the way you do because it's going to be different depending on the kind of problem.</data>

  <data key="d1">i've found that saying well i can just up and move my life. live out of my car. even fly to another country helps. it's kind of the same bag, but an alternative to suicide. it's like, if i don't want to give up everything and just move away, then maybe i don't actually want to give up everything. and if that's the case, then maybe i shouldn't be focused on killing myself. there is comfort in knowing there's an alternative. but suicide is so final, it should really be the last one.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'll preface this by saying i had pretty rough death anxiety. so when i developed the ideas of why secure a future we all die anyway know i developed it from a very different place. in saying that you can train yourself or simply shift your focus to acknowledge that if you're gonna die anyway there really is no reason to not just full send it with the time you have left. that's in quotations because obviously it's not simple but at risk of sounding like a guru, how you focus on things can be a very powerful tool.</data>

  <data key="d1">or maybe they subconsciously ignore your symptoms if they don't believe in mental illness. it may also be that this is a kind of selffulfilling prophecy they think that you are happy and you have nothing short of nothing, so they do not look for things that do not fit their imaginations. i think that after all, you should tell them about how you feel because maybe the vision that you want to kill yourself will be an impulse for them to help. i know you may think the school psychologist will ignore your problems because of your material status etc. but i would try to talk to him. unless you have a teacher you trust or the parent of one of your friends, talk to them. when your parents feel pressure from the environment, they will help you, if only because there are no rumors about them. i hope you will find the help you need.</data>

  <data key="d1">nah its fine. my advice is just to slowly ghost them until youre not talking everyday like usual. it might hurt at first but youll get over it. make sure they can contact you but dont be super responsive when they message. i had another friend literally tell me straight out dont blame us if you kill yourself and it really hurt so dont confront them directly with this feeling of unease or youll hurt your friend and theyll likely spiral. always be nondirect but dont string them along either. make it clear theyre not a big part of your life anymore. you can also add some sentimental crap so you feel better about your decision. if you ever need help just let me know were brothers yada yada. you dont even have to mean it because its just for the other persons psyche. thats just my personal experience though of how my best friend cut me out of his life though. im legit the exact description of what you just described minus the no college degree thing.</data>

  <data key="d1">i was the opposite of you, i was depressed and i ghosted and cut my friends out before they could do it to me, so they wouldn't have to feel bad about it. also, it was hard for me to keep it up with them when i always felt so sad and they were normalish. i'm sorry it turned out shitty for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">lol i actually did that first but i kept coming back into the friend group because of my emotional neediness.i think i cut contact like 24 times before the friend group finally got sick of me. you always just come back to start something and then leave was something one of the friends who probably disliked me the most said. which was fair. the final straw was when i called out the group leader my best friend for ghosting some other dude and also not listening to him when he wanted me to unmute his then girlfriend. i think he finally just had enough. and at that time, after some hostility between us, one of my other friends who i felt close to leaked private conversations about misgivings i had about another friend the one who said dont blame us if you kill yourself in the group. so i guess no one really liked me anymore and i was a depressed loser. it was an easy choice for everyone.</data>

  <data key="d1">the most interesting aspect of suffering is the sufferer's belief in its absoluteness. he believes he has a monopoly on suffering. i think that i alone suffer, that i alone have the right to suffer, although i also realize that there are modalities of suffering more terrible than mine, pieces of flesh falling from the bones, the body crumbling under one's very eyes, monstrous, criminal , shameful sufferings. emil cioran.</data>

  <data key="d1">fellow smoker and friend here. i too stopped smoking due to a drug test. it's hard, but in my experience after a week or two, the withdrawals diminish. everything will seem dull for a while, but personally, i felt so much better after the initial withdrawals. for me, oral fixation and different adrenaline helped me. cinnamon gum and short all out sprints around the block helped me. you're not alone. you have all of us here. much love.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think a friend and a fiance are great . good for you. a problem with so much media, put reddit aside is it stressed unrealistic ideas onto people of what life should be like. it's all made up. i should know i work on a television show. a lot of people have very happy live with just a friend or two. but if you look at your life and compare it to all the crap that is out there on your screen big or small it will cloud your judgment. all those people staring into their screens, that is not a life. i'm way over 40 and still don't have a smart phone.</data>

  <data key="d1">suicide is at the tippy top of that list. other options include being unbearably alone without any help or support because people dont give a fuck about me. then being homeless because i cant have a job because of my stupid fucking dad who forces me to sleep at 5 am and always sleep deprived. dont have money for my own car or anything, not that my controlling dad would allow me to anyway. once he becomes cripple i'll probably be in my mid 20s to early 30s. guess who won't know how to do shit because of helicopter parents. fuck them, and fuck privileged people like you thinking their advice means shit. i wanna be dead okay? is that too much to ask? does that affect you at all? once i'm dead you dont have to fake care like others do. i get it, its cool to virtual signal or whatever but im fed up with it. even if i somehow escaped poverty i'll still end up having dementia and only be able to go as far as the length of my catheter. i won't be able to even conversate with people in a nursing home when i'm brain dead and uncontrollably drooling.</data>

  <data key="d1">be the person you want to be. if you see no worth in your life, then make it your goal to improve others. it can be as small as some community service, or as large as working as a doctor and saving lives. i asked the same question about a year ago. i still havent got a clear answer from anyone. just live your life like theirs no tomorrow. go swimming. cool a meal. play sports. try anything and everything available. youll eventually find something you like. as for your heartbreak, i feel you. while she wasnt my gf, she was a friend i could trust with any of my issues. after she ditched me, i took the available time to change up my lifestyle. i recommend that you reflect back on your mistakes, and try to make them better. if your doing poor in school, spend some time studying. if you made someone mad, apologize to them. having a clean slate on your lifestyle gives you a chance to boost your mental health.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm glad it brings you some peace, it's true that setting a date can help deal with what's pushing towards such a decision, even if in the emd you dont follow through. i wont bother you asking to not do it, since i get it would do more for me than for you. instead, i'd like to suggest trying other choices in the meantime. if you're leaving, you can do or try anything you want to, because if it goes well that's good, and if it doesnt, who cares? you could try to change one or some of the things that have been bothering you. or to share with your loved ones the things that arent easy to share. after all, that freedom you feel is real and yours, so why not use it? i hope that you'll find reasons to keep around, but if not, at least i hope this time to be nice and enjoyable. i know you're a good person and deserve better, and the most solid proof is that even after dealing with this for so long, you're still thinking of how to leave while hurting others as little as possible. it's not easy yo still worry about others when having to endure this much weight.</data>

  <data key="d1">i try to be a good person. i haven't been. i've been toxic and hurting people i care about for years now. i am aware of this, but still fail to change because i don't try. i continue to hurt them. i feel guilty about it. i want to be better, but it's too late for me. i don't have the motivation to do anything anymore. we are taking care of our disabled mother for years now and i am exhausted from it. we attend to her 247 and we never had a day off. she doesn't show any interest in getting better, and throws tantrums when things don't go her way. i'm not equipped to handle this kind of behavior for this long. i've hurt her verbally and sometimes physically when i can't control my temper. it's tiring to help someone who doesn't want to help themselves. that's why i don't blame my family if they're done with helping me with my issues. i'm too tired to do anything about this anymore. i wish to end things now. but i'll keep in mind what you said and try to fix some things and make my stay less miserable for them. it's the least i can do for them for putting up with me this long. thank you for your comment. it's been so long since someone validated my emotions. you're a good person. i wish the best for you.</data>

  <data key="d1">you've went through much we all have moments or periods in which we dont act perfectly and do things we repent from. the past, even the scars or open wounds it leaves, doesnt determine our future. excuse me for talking about myself, but i've been an awful person, one who didnt want to change. i've hurt people i loved, i've been unable to feel anything during moments i think i should have. i even set a date, not to take my life, but to take anothers. and i spent years thinking all that was ok, or that i could not change it. also, i didnt take much care of myself, because i saw no point if life and i didnt seem to be made for each other. yet i managed to get back from there. i still have my flaws and struggles, but i've walked a long way. and i'm not that strong, great or kind. at least, not much more than anybody else. we can endure more than we believe, more than we should have to. thank you for your good wishes, and please, consider that if i can be called a good person, you definitely are.</data>

  <data key="d1">even if you could get therapy you'd still have to be careful because of legal bullshit. they're just as likely to get you committed against your will as they are to help you. our systems are fundamentally broken because they primarily exist to generate profit... not to heal us. i feel powerless to help you, and i feel powerless to help myself. we both deserve better. sometimes the only thing that keeps me going is anger.</data>

  <data key="d1">i hear this re. anger. oh and fun fact these days even when you can get therapy, it is often time limited. so you don't get help for exactly as long as you need it, but only for as long as they feel like giving it to you. we have to get through the wait list, many more people need our therapy center's help. so then you prematurely lose yet another important relationship. it truly makes one wonder, why bother? and the system benefits when you don't bother to seek help.</data>

  <data key="d1">being an autistic gay girl puts you pretty low on the privilege ladder. being neurodivergent is enough of a struggle, let alone having a narcissist mom and shitty r culture protecting friends and gross guys. dont unalive yourself though, you deserve so much more than you have, and it is out there. there are people and communities out there that have seen the same experiences and are worth being alive to be around.</data>

  <data key="d1">its not really about the fact that you're too young or privileged to want to kill yourself. hell, there are people who's lives are going great and they still want to kill themselves. externally, people may seem fine, but we never know what's going on with people internally. most likely if you tell someone why you're feeling depressed or suicidal, depending on your issues, they will probably judge you based on those said problems and your lifestyle. and by judge you i mean let's say your issues for example. you seem like you're in a good place in life, you have a home, you're eating, you haven't been physically abused, but your family and social life seems to be taking a toll on you mentally. in my personal opinion, mentality is more importantconcerning or damaging than anything physically if that makes sense? sure, you could ditch your friends, but as you said it would be hard to find new ones, especially nowadays with this current generation. you'd be lucky to actually meet some decent nice folks who you can count on as friends. now family is harder to deal with, because you can't necessarily ditch them, unless you're planning to move out and live somewhere far enough to where it's just you with no relatives around. some people need to realize though, family isn't always eveything. in most people's cases, the people you thought you could count on to always be there for you physically, mentally, and emotionally aren't always there or never was to begin with. just because you share blood doesn't mean they will share their heart. moral of the story, put yourself first. you putting others happiness before your own is only going to ruin your mentality more.</data>

  <data key="d1">i would recommend going to a doctor and tell them that you are feeling this way, anti depressants may help you a also recommend going walks, i know it can be hard so start small just go around the block or even just sit down on an outside bench, feed the ducks. i think at the end of the day life has no set meaning so give it a meaning whether it be you want to cure cancer or sit on every bench in the city it can be as big or small as you want it to be. i believe that you can do it and strongly recommend feeding the ducks, it always puts a smile on my face</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah i'm the same when it comes to friends, my older brother and i grew up being friends with two brothers who almost matched our ages and they're both always busy nowadays and my 2 other best friends who are also brothers just kind of changed and do their own thing so i don't see hanging out with them being a realistic scenario. so i've only relied on my lo and we've been on a break for almost two months so im miserable and don't really socialize with anyone other than my kitten lucy and my asshole cat kitten long story behind his name. but i really do think if you let someone you trust know that you need to socialize and ask if you could plan something, then they'd probably be up for it. i haven't told my best friend about my mental issues yet but if i were you, i'd ask how a friend how they feel about mental health issues, even if its awkward, its been worth it to me. i've also found a lot of relief in just taking things into my own hands by going online and trying to research whatever i can for myself. that might just be a way to make me feel in control though idk. i hope you're doing alright friend, and i'm sorry if i was rambling about stuff you don't care about for too long.</data>

  <data key="d1">i go by myself sometimes but how do you find people to talk to when no one else goes anywhere alone? people just talk to whoever theyre with. like i said i am friendly. i can make conversation but i maybe get in a couple minutes of small talk and then it never goes anywhere.</data>

  <data key="d1">the easiest place to start is going to activities that you enjoy like cooking or running. doing something you like helps to relax and makes it easier to connect with. start with doing it online if you are uncomfortable doing it in person at first. im sure you can make some friends, this is coming from someone who struggles in making and maintaining friends</data>

  <data key="d1">speaking as a long time loner you can do lots of things on your own, you dont have to be with other people. ive been abroad on holiday alone, i even went to see a rock show in germany and i live in the uk, and i drove all around iceland a few years ago. i go out taking photos. i ride my bike. so do you have hobbies? what i would suggest strongly is not judging yourself negatively or you will stay as what you say you are. and the longer that goes on for the harder itll be to change. words are powerful, brains are very susceptible to them and what you say about yourself can be destructive. so try and be positive. where in the world are you? are there any social groups or meetups for singles with interests or for just meeting up, going for a walk, going out for a meal? the trouble with the big wide world is people have established lives and arent always looking for new people to be friends with, so most chats seldom go further than just short chats. and the other problem is finding the in, the introduction, the thing to get any conversation going in the first place. but, yes, it is hard and i do sympathise.</data>

  <data key="d1">i was in a similar position to you once. the fact that you have acknowledged that this is happening is really good progress, as it shows acceptance. try talking to loved ones about it and seeing if they have any valuable advice. even if they don't, it's very important to keep your loved ones updated on your feelings, as it helps you come to terms with them yourself. when it comes to friends, look for a hobby that you have, and start from there. look for nice people, who feel comfortable being themselves around you, as these people usually make the best friends</data>

  <data key="d1">speaking as a pathetic, lonely loser, things happen when they do, you just have to put yourself out there. i spent 37 years feeling exactly the same way i must say i always had pets and that made everything much easier you can do anything with pets and they are a great conversation starter, plus they always made me feel more confident and then one day i met my future wife on a dating app, and now , 6 years later, i'm married with 3 beautiful children. i'm still a pathetic, lonely loser, but they don't seem to care. hang in there.</data>

  <data key="d1">dude you are in the same place i was just a few years ago! and your life is not pathetic. assholes and society in general might make you feel like shit for not having friends or dates but everyday people are not worried about your social status. you said it yourself that you have good relationships with people at work. i was the same way couldnt make any friends at school but got along well with people at work or people who didnt have much in common with me. the social pressure of school or being a cool person when trying to make friends came make everything seem so unattainable. i felt like i would never be cool enough for someone to take their time to get to know me. but those other relationships prove that you are an interesting person worthy of knowing and being friends with! as for the milestones i get fomo too. wish i had more friends to celebrate graduation with and worry that maybe i wont be celebrating anniversaries and birthdays with a family in the future. but life is so fucking enjoyable on your own too. maybe youre like me and have some social anxiety. focusing on yourself and your hobbies can be very rewarding and increase your confidence in the fact that you are an interesting and unique person. and that people will want to get to know you!</data>

  <data key="d1">running clubs are the only thing that truly works for me for making friends, but they work incredibly well. you go for a group run and if someone is running next to you then you chat for a bit. ask them about their lives and stuff. then afterwards, just say, i'm going for lunch, do you want to come? now you are in an intimate place and talking face to face and bonding. its remarkable actually.</data>

  <data key="d1">there might be a walking group or meditation group you can join nearby. libraries have book clubs and interesting lectures and discussions. ive heard of knitting circles that seem pretty open to newbies and beginners. just some thoughts. i didnt have any friends in my city or know anyone except from work or family. im not religious but a few years ago i started attending the local quaker meeting because i thought their politics were interesting and they seemed to welcome atheists like me. i just kept going, eventually seeing the same people over and over again turned into friendships. it was awkward gathering a coffee and a plate of snacks to go and sit without knowing anyone, but people introduced themselves to me. another time i just decided to go sing karaoke at the local pub by myself. wound up chatting with a few people, made a friend ive hung out with many times since. its uncomfortable, but worth it. hugs.</data>

  <data key="d1">i wonder, do you care so much about being social because it's actually what you want or because it's what society pushes as desirable? i'm autistic and have grappled with this. i have poor social skills, haven't had a friend since 5th grade now almost 20. for many years i dreamed about being social because of this generalized idea that it would just make things better. i realized it's because it's what society deems as meaningful, and not because i'm actually lacking anything due to not being social. in reality, when i do social things, i feel exhausted and beat afterwards. i'd really just prefer to be at home with my pets in peace. i wonder if this may be the case for you as well because you call your life pathetic and refer to yourself as a pathetic lonely loser because you're not social. this post seems more like a struggle with selfworth than loneliness. is not being social the real issue here, or is it being harsh on yourself because you are not meeting a societal or idealistic standard? might be something to consider.</data>

  <data key="d1">well, you are not a loser. what you are describing above are just material things. and you are a really good writer. your sentences are clear, you have good grammar, and you paint a picture with your words. i'm not trying to make light of anything, and i'm know you are in some pain, but honestly you are a gifted writer. i mean, what you wrote could be the start of a really good piece of writing. you leave everyone wondering about your experiences and what your life is like. honestly it sounds pretty interesting. i was in your boat, so to speak, about 10 15 years ago my parents actually ended up kicking me out of their house when they moved i guess they couldn't leave me there but things got better. there are a lot of really good people out there who don't really care who you live with, or how much money you have, etc. you are judging yourself really harshly. but other people won't necessarily do the same. you are more than you think you are.</data>

  <data key="d1">youve said you dont want to die, i understand wholeheartedly the want to sleep for 10yrs or disappear entirely. but if you can see a possibility things could be better in 10yrs indicates you still have possibilities to live for. taking 10yrs one day at a time and opening up to the people youre leaving this letter for in that time could make things better sooner, its worked for me and best of all i still exist and can see how things pan out,its meant im here to see this message from you. best tip i can give is to call the people who you want to leave the letter for, you dont have to tell them how youre feeling unless you want to, but its always worth checking in with people to see how they are and find out youre not as alone as these big feelings feel</data>

  <data key="d1">it's ok, sometimes we feel like we don't measure up. sometimes we doubt our value and think others are better or more worthy of anything, happiness, etc. then we compare ourselves, either to someone else or to a past version of ourselves. we judge, criticise and mistreat ourselves to the point of feeling utterly worthless. your post shows something very important about you, it shows you have empathy. it's quite common in these situations, we can empathise with others too much, to the point where you value them over you. im not saying this is your scenario but it's very common. so i can say absolutely, unequivocally you are far from worthless, you are the light we need in this world, its difficult because you feel so at odds with the world. you are the sane person in the insane world. humanity fucked up when we started to value the material over everything else, we now live in a world where love has little value but money and status are everything. we view success as being wealthy or having nice things, it's all back to front so no wonder we can feel like it's all bullshit. the problem is we are creatures borne from love, with an infinite capacity to love and be loved i'm talking fundamental humanity love, not man and wife type stuff but we are trained to be selfish, to expect love but not to give it. we all owe a debt of love to each other, do you pay it forward? or demand payment? if nothing else, i love you man. we're brothers, even if you don't realise it. i need you to stay man, you're important to me.</data>

  <data key="d1">that's rough. are you taking any medication for it? if the doctor said it should've cleared up by now then maybe it's taking longer then a normal case. these kinds of numbers are usually averages so it would make sense for longer times to exist. i have little doubt that it will eventually clear up and return to normal. give it some time. i know you already have, but like i said, it's likely just taking longer to clear up than the average expected time.</data>

  <data key="d1">i woke up this morning and the pain subsided for a few hours maybe it's getin better. i think i'll kill myself if it doesn't. only medication i got is nsaidsthat don't really do anything. i was adjusting to finally getting out of a toxic job. thinking about all the missed opportunities of my life and was just about rdy to really try with dating and stuff again then bam this happens a d now i can't think about anything else. i don't feel like i can do anything now. i was diagnosed with high functioning autism very late on.i don't think i've been happy since i was 12, other than maybe a few years in my 20s when i first discovered alcohol but was mostly surrounded by fake people. when i was 17 i spoke to a girl i met on some internet forum on 56k dial up she was lovely i should have been a better friend. i met up recently. and i thought something.might happen. got my heart broken again. it was too late. its pethetic but i thought she might have been my soul mate. everything's too late i haven't stopped crying for 6 weeks</data>

  <data key="d1">that doesn't mean no one is out there for you. that doesn't mean the pain will last for ever. i feel as though perhaps you rely too much on external sources of pleasure. perhaps you should first find internal peace or joy in life rather than seek something else to make you happy. even if that happiness is simply not being sad. most people aren't happy all the time. where that could come from for you... i'm not sure. it's different for everyone and it took me quite a while to find it and realize it. i would've never found it if i gave up. don't give up either, try to find it, perhaps you already tried but try a different way. discomfort is followed by satisfaction. like an itch followed by the relief of a scratch. go find your relief, first perhaps a relief of this pain, then deal with your emotional issues. if you need more help, you can talk to me if i'm online.</data>

  <data key="d1">the small things theres honestly no major purpose to life, and that may be disappointing but lifes meaning is what you want it to be. maybe its just an act of kindness for another person or a good talk with a friend or even just walking in the park as the sunsets. these are small insignificant things, but they are the things that give life its meaning its beauty. oftentimes we see life as mundane and boring and you say yourself that even fulfilling days are lacking, but what if you view them differently? and just remember to be kind to yourself and if you feel like it treat yourself or do something you like. youre human you have human needs and wants and desires and you should embrace them.</data>

  <data key="d1">i appreciate your reply. ive posted on this subreddit before when i was severely depressed. i was going to kill myself but didnt for some reason. i dont even feel depressed any more life has just lost its meaning. i try so hard every day to make my life mean something and in the end there are people who dont have to try and surpass me in every way. i find very little pleasure in talking to people which is what most people say life is all about. im just not sure what to do with myself anymore. gonna be honest the thing that sparked this today was that i failed a drug screen for a job because of a prescription i take and on the way out of the parking lot i backed into a car and its the first time ive ever been in any kind of accident so i didnt take any pictures or anything. im so stressed out about the text im going to get or the ticket or whatever the fuck happens. its such a dumb reason to spark an existential crisis but i think it was just the last straw for me after the last few months. sorry this was so wordy</data>

  <data key="d1">its a myth that only people who are less successful, have trauma etc. can be depressed. mental illness can affect anyone, no matter how great your life may seem. i would recommend seeing a doctor and discussing your feelings, perhaps starting therapy andor medication to manage your feelings. itd be a shame to throw away what youve worked so hard for lose a family who loves you.</data>

  <data key="d1">are you familiar with depersonalisation derealisation? my psychiatrist told me its a common feeling in anxiety disorders or generally in stressfull situations. i can symphatize, i usually have no desire to do anything or feel anything, or even think anything. i wish i was asleep, even after years of therapy. but sometimes i snap back into reality. this weak sense of self is sometimes freeing tho. idk where im going with this, just wanted you to know i really understand what youre feeling.</data>

  <data key="d1">my dad just died by suicide last week. i am the executor of his estate so i have his phone,computers, paperwork etc. some things i have noticed he made a will 4 years ago which seemed normal but a few months ago he asked to add me to his checking account red flag in hindsight, he used to keep a good record of expenses in his checkbook but in the couple months before he did this he got lazier about it also he started donating more st judes childrens hospital. i found a suicide letter from 2 years ago in his phone documents so he clearly had been contemplating it for at least 2 years. also, i think he was close to doing it in april, he had cancelled some subscriptions and stuff on april 4, then restarted them a couple weeks later.</data>

  <data key="d1">look, you are not alone. i feel the same, but i feel this way a lot so i do some of that to help when i feel this way. its how i let my darkness out. one thing i do is write. like so much. but its getting it out. i actually made a sub that i use to post my bs train stories, coping skills, processing the trauma. just know its very dark though. well theres a few good things, but im working on it. i was going to just post my suicide note on there nevermind i did. but im trying to hold on for now. but that just let go feeling is very appealing. so im just saying im a freaking mess, but i have done this for so long, i know a few things. feel free to post your shit if you want. however, i dont know your medium to get this suit out. what do you like to do paint, write, etc?</data>

  <data key="d1">at first it didn't matter, but when the years go by and you realize that at your age, all people have already done at least one of those things and when they talk of stuff like that, you realise that you have no idea about it because you've never experienced it. and it makes you feel like you've wasted all those years that will never come back. i'd say that's the main reason.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey, it's natural to be afraid of getting help. our brains evolved to run away from hungry wildcats, they haven't yet evolved to let go of that fear, even when it's something like a friend joining a chat. getting help when you're suicidal and young is really important, but it's also really terrifying, and there is no shame in struggling to get it. you deserve help no matter what</data>

  <data key="d1">hey man. i suffer from pretty much the exact same thing. feeling insecure about myself because of supposedly superior peers, kinda losing myself and becoming more of a shut in. now i managed to escape the toxic friends i used to have, they too would occasionally belittle me. i truly believe you should drop them. all they will do is lower your mood. in my eyes no friends are better than those that will verbally abuse you. sure being without friends sucks for a while however i find that it can help rekindle old passions that you neglected. and hey, making new more supportive friends is an enjoyable journey in itself. trust me man, while it does sound clich, things can and will get better for you. build up that confidence, maybe start a new hobby that you may enjoy. life can be enjoyed alone as well. so just hang in there ok? if you need to talk i can. i may not be brilliant but hey, its something.</data>

  <data key="d1">sadly friends and family dont want to hear negative things. they think everyone is supposed to be happy 247 because negative feelings make them feel bad. they dont want to hear about how they make you feel bad or anything. that being said empathy is something alot of people lack. most people only care about themselves. you may seek a therapist or find a good friend that will listen. i do my best to listen and be there for friends but sadly everyone abandons me when i am down in the dumps. so i am at the point where i just want to end it myself.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think there's a difference between forgiveness and redemption. forgiveness is something done by the person who was harmed and it's a matter of them coming to terms with what happened. redemption on the other hand is about the wrong doer seeking to be better. you can't make them forgive you, but you can seek redemption by trying to learn from your mistakes and change your ways. that's not only a right but a responsibility i think. you can and should be as good as you can be. for what it's worth, maybe some day you can forgive yourself, because in a way, you've also harmed yourself by taking yourself down that dark path and that's something you may need to let go of to progress on your path to redemption. it sounds like you were also really mentally unwell to behave in this manner in the first place. that's no excuse mind you, but it is worth trying to understand whatever it is that lead you to behave so inappropriately. what allowed you to justify it at the time? what did you expect to gain by being like that? whowhat influenced those actions? it might be worth trying to go over this with a therapist if you can. understanding what lead you astray might prevent you from falling back into those old habits and mindsets.</data>

  <data key="d1">i was terribly lonely and was so desperate for any form of attention i blurted out anything for shock value. i was basically those kids on 4chan saying the nword for reactions. i think i justified it at the time by being like, it was just a joke, cause in my head i was never serious. i would never have thought before i had spoken, instead the latter. it basically morphed me into this massive dick who was an asshole for attention. it's like the saying, all publicity is good publicity. i wanted anybody to see what the fuck was happening with me and acknowledge me. looking back now i realize that i was really pathetic and looked like an incel, which is far from what i am capable of being. i am probably gonna go to therapy this year, or at least like 1 counsellor. maybe in september, idrk. like i said, i have changed fundamentally as a person. i have strayed away from any joke or statement of that dark of a subject matter. i don't blame anybody for my actions but me. i had a shitty relationship with my parents, massive social anxiety and major depression but that wasn't the cause of my actions. it was a desperation for attention that manifested in horrifying things that i fully regret. i have been working on myself ever since then, having better habits, more selfcare, and learning that they probably won't forgive me, and i have to live with that. i just want to gain redemption and escape the husk of myself that i once was. that's why i changed my name and my personality to an extent.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think it's good to work on yourself. idk how old you are, but for guys my age in our 30s now, we can all remember being horrible, edgy shit heads in highschoolcollege. boys were socialized terrible back when we were growing up, and while it doesn't make our shitty behavior justifiable, most the guys i know have grown a lot since them, and we all have that regret. the patriarchal structure of things makes men act terrible, but you don't have to be stuck in that toxic lifestyle forever. i think it's important to forgive yourself at some point too. not just to feel better, but so that you can be better. it's hard to be good when all you ever tell yourself is that your a monster.</data>

  <data key="d1">is this your first video therapy session? will you have more in the future? from my experience with therapy, the first session is answering basic questions about yourself, the therapist discussing their credentials and its not a lot of deep work. i find it helpful for myself to write out the goals of what i want out of the session and a page of something to talk about, sometimes ill go through my old vent posts here or look in conversations with friends where ive been at my lowest. i am pretty sure there is a guide posted in the sidebar that helps people find therapists who are trained in suicidal thoughts and depression. im pretty sure you shouldnt be committed if you say you want to get better and dont have an active plan to hurt yourself or others.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes it will be the first therapy session. i'm not sure if there will be more, as they are difficult to schedule. though being consistent with it may help i'll just have to see how it goes. it didn't occur to me, but it may be good if the first session is just an outline to get a general feel for the process. i'm not sure if therapy will accomplish much, but i guess it's something. thanks for the insight.</data>

  <data key="d1">my ocd usually involves thoughts that are more harmrelated than suiciderelated, so while i don't have the exact same experience, i do know what it's like to be afraid of doing something that i find personally reprehensible. one thing that might help is trying to internalize the idea that your thoughts about suicide don't have to mean anything. thoughts are private, internal things, and regardless of their content, they don't indicate anything about your worth as a person. given what has happened over the past year, it seems very natural that you would have suicide on your mind, but thinking about suicide doesn't mean that you want to do anything about those thoughts, or that you will do anything about them. acting on thoughts is a choice, but thoughts themselves cannot hurt you. this is the type of thinking that i've found helpful in combating my own struggles with ocd, so maybe it will help you. may also have some advice. i'm sorry to hear about the past year, op. i hope this next one is better, and that you're able to find some relief.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey friend. im glad youre here. your suffering is real and theres no sugarcoating how much it sucks. but the way you write tells me youre insightful, bighearted, and based on how you choose your words probably really funny when you want to be. i dont know if youd credit yourself with those things, but its evident in how you composed your post. you talk like someone who can really give others joy. and im really sorry that you have trouble finding your own when you so genuinely deserve it. nobody feels this way without very good reason, whether the reason is internal chemistry or external circumstances or some combination of the two. your feelings are normal and natural. i hope you get a little bitesized joy in the next 24 hours, and another in the following 24 hours. big joys are a lot to ask for when were in it this deep, but little joys can happen easily. a nice sunrise, a snuggle with a pet, hearing a song you like, someone holding a door for you, a perfect mug of coffee. something. i hope you get a little joy and i hope your pain eases up a little. thank you for talking it out here.</data>

  <data key="d1">my heart broke when i read your story. whatever i say might not convince you, but i will do my best anyways because you are important, whether you want to believe it or not. get out of that job. i know you said it's the only one you can get due to your disabilities, but its just not worth it. you are clearly hurting and aren't getting paid enough, albeit i have no idea your situation and without proper judgment this is all i can really say about your job. if you want to give me some more specifics of what your dealing with, i will help pitch you some alternative job choices im only 18f so i'm terribly sorry if it's not great choices but i'm willing to do my research for you. as for your childhood trauma, that is not your fault. you are a victim, you are not the one to blame for anything. i can only imagine how much it hurts, but these incidents shouldn't dictate your life. you're so much better than you realize, whoever did that to you is pathetic and scum under my shoe i don't care about whatever kind of relationship you still have with them, some things just can't be forgiven. you can't let them win, and this might be the cheesiest thing you've ever read but you are a lot stronger than you think. you also talked about how there's nothing and nobody to tie you to this life, and honestly, i'm going through that same feeling. you have somebody who loves you, and don't even start thinking that you're being selfish because you want to end your life because that will just send you into a spiral and thats not what you need. i'm sure you've considered therapy if you haven't then do that now and if you have actually gone through with therapy without any results, maybe its time to go to a psychiatrist. i don't know your financial status but there is no amount of money that can replace you. save up for it even if you don't think it's worth it. i hope that what i said helps you even if it's just a little, i hope you recognize that even though i'm a stranger, you are important to me. i found familiarity in your story, a comfort almost, and i want you to have a good ending. you don't have to cut your story short, i will shower you with positivity whether you like it or not. if you do end up reading this, let me know if anything i said was out of place i'm kinda dumb with words. i hope you are safe and have an amazing rest of your day or at least try to</data>

  <data key="d1">this might end up being a tangent, but im going to try and touch on all of what you have said in your comment. to provide further details, and just to make some stuff more clear that i didnt state in my post. im honestly so suicidal that i dont have a lot to type than waaa im suffering. first thing first, my job. can relate about not knowing stuff because im 19, only a year older than you, so i dont know what options there are for me. i have multiple disabilities, only one physically that causes me the most issues. i dont know what the diagnosis is, i was never told, but i have severely fucked up ankles, to the point i cant even stand while cooking without pain. i need a desk job, as much as i hate to admit such a thing. the only dream i ever had was to be a veterinarian but with the ankle disability, it would never work. on top of that autism and adhd which i never learned to properly cope with, so social skills and learning are not my strong suits, both of which are required for being a vet, as well as my current job which is why it causes me so much stress. i have wanted to quit for a few weeks from my current job because of the whole adhdautism bullshit, but because i have only worked here two months, i feel obligated to stay, which is part of the reason i want to die so much. it feels like im trapped in this job, in this life, and just everything. i feel like things will truly never get better. i was also born into a family that was too poor to be middle class, but just poor enough to get food stamps, yet not be considered poverty. because of that i got a huge ass fear of debt, which my parents have a lot of and will likely be passed to me when they die. childhood trauma is spicy as all hell. i try not to say im a victim because there was a period in my life where i was straight up abusive. granted, at the time i was being sexually abused and was just taking it out on my abusers, but they constantly called me abusive and it got into my head like a song that plays on repeat. ive been told by each of my 4 therapists that i am very resilient, but my battle feels to have come to an end. i can agree, my abusers are dogshit, and i wish one of them wasnt my mom because it left me in an almost stockholm syndrome kind of vibe with her. i have to live at home, so i have to deal with her and my brother, as well as my father though my father never sexually assaulted me or sexually abused me, unlike my brother and mother. hes verbally abusive, and im his special target. its not that they would be winning, per say, but moreso that id be winning in my own sense. i have struggled for so long with these suicidal thoughts and have never had a waking moment of what i felt like was peace and happiness though i will say, my husband is the only one who has made me genuinely happy. i definitely have people who care about me, like my chosen sister like, not actually biological family, but shes someone closer to me than actual family. i know i have friends and two beautiful cats, one of which was the only reason i lived during my sexual abuse from my best friend. it sucks i cant get off of work and just hold her, because i know that would potentially help. same with a hug from my husband, who i also cant hug because hes at home. i honestly dont think im terribly selfish for wanting to die. its more reversed to thinking the people who want me are selfish. if you see a cat with a serious condition with no quality of life, one would put it down. why cant i just be put down iykwim. as far as therapist and psychiatrists go, ive had several of each. im on medications that merely dull my symptoms of mental health, since what i have cant be solved by meds. truly, the only thing i can do is learn to cope with my deep pain, but that sounds like a miserable existence to me. like?? idk. just imagine living your life knowing you will always feel this deep pain at some point and all you can do is try to survive it, even though it will always come back, one way or another. i find some comfort in your words as a whole, and you didnt say anything dumb at all. i feel as if ive already given up before i tried to put up another fight.</data>

  <data key="d1">thank you for responding so honestly, i know it can be a bit challenging so, thank you again ! again i'm gonna tackle the job subject first. adhd is something i also struggle with, i know what it's like to always be or feel like i am one step behind the others and not being able to cope and being severely socially awkward. that being said, your position is like me trying to win a swimming race with a shark, i will always be the one losing and obviously thats gonna get to me. you owe your job nothing, leave even if you feel like you shouldn't. this job of yours is not something you're passionate about and you'll never be able to find a stable state of mind at this rate. i'm pretty confident i would beat a shark in a running race, and so for you, you gotta start with something you'll have the upper hand in. i work as an art teacher for a small business and i teach 28 year olds how to do art. am i good at art? i want to think i am but i'm probably dogwater in the eyes of society. but these are kids i'm working with, no real social interaction, no real skill needed, just patience. instead of giving up your dreams of being a veterinarian, there are other jobs that involve helping animals. but since the both of us are still kinda young, i will try to avoid professional jobs. if you're comfortable enough with driving theres tons of delivery services that require little to no human interaction but maybe some minor walking. if you don't feel comfortable with that then give me another moment to think of some other alternatives. your disabilities don't define your potential, so no, you are not going to be forever binded to the dreaded desk job. if you want an animalbased job, i'll get back to you on that because my smooth brain only knows of like 6 jobs rip. i still view you as a victim, not justifying your abusive behavior but i would've done the same exact fucking thing, so i don't blame you for that. you've clearly realized that who you were in the past wasn't a good person, and i think that that is what separates you from the other abusers in your family. this next part might sound either intrusive or just plain easier said than done type of business but again, i'm gonna do my best. get out of that house girl. if possible live with your husband you've probably tried or your literally unable to so this piece of advice is trash. if you have any other relatives or any close friends who are willing to take you in for at least a few days, go for it. you're orbiting in the cycle of abuse, we both know you don't deserve that. i'm also so happy you have your chosen sister in your life, i know how much better it is having even just one person in your life . also drop the coordinates of your abusive ex hopefully best friend, i may not be a threat myself but god i know some people who are, that person who hurt you is as good as a disabled cat with no arms and no legs, they're the ones who needs to be put down. side note i would care for that metaphorical cat with all of my heart because animals are my weakness. you on the other hand, you aren't in need of being put down. as much as you deny it, you are functioning human, despite the disabilities, you are still able to do way more than you think. i also just put that selfish part in because a lot of people tend to play that card. i understand where you're coming from, the don't they see how much it hurts to wake up everyday, why won't they just put me out of my misery mindset, i'm the same way, but your surroundings are whats holding you back. take your cats, quit your job, get a new job that doesn't make you want to skin yourself alive, and focus on yourself and who you are as a person. your existence doesn't have to revolve around dealing or fixing the things about yourself, you can thrive, you're young, you have a husband and a chosen sister and they damn well love you for who you are. you're not giving yourself enough credit, you're lovable, you're just being held back by uncontrollable forces, and thats not fair. if you're comfortable with telling me, do you gowant to go to college? i know the financial situation can cause some problems but you should never feel stuck somewhere, there are ways and colleges out there where you could escape your little bubble of abuse. after rereading that, i really sound like an ad or something to promote college but bare with me here, i'm trying my best with my little pea brain. also, the medicine that you were prescribed might not be the one best for you. i know this may sound crazy but, your dna might not correspond with the medication you were given. i'm not a doctor so the best advice i have is to see if it's possible to take any dna test and see if any medication is compatible with it. i don't know how to end this so uh... do your best and get through work you have a cuddly little baby waiting for you afterwards !!</data>

  <data key="d1">you've done so much, no need to stress yourself out this badly for some few dumb grades, it's not worth it. do you have any friends irl that could help you with studying? of course they won't be able to help you with the suicidal thoughts because they clearly don't understand, but you can ask here, and people will provide answers. if your sister means that much to you, use her as a source of hope, the reason you keep on fighting.</data>

  <data key="d1">the waves are calling you, because eventually you will return to them. as will i, as will every human youve ever known or not known. i draw comfort from waves since i grew up at the shore here in sweden. when the larger boats go by they make larger waves we still hop in to enjoy the rocking those waves dont last, only for a few seconds they throw us up and down, but we dive in every time to enjoy just a few more waves. you are going to be okay. it may feel so so dark, but i need you to hold on for me. just a little while longer.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm sorry to hear you're struggling. it was written perfectly. you're probably sick of hearing this, but you are so young. being young is weird because you hear a lot of people telling you that you have your whole life ahead of you, but you also have a lot of people treating you like you're not old enough to have real struggles. that's so untrue and so hurtful. some of my biggest struggles were at that age. but i will say that at 20, you don't have to be good and you don't have to amount to anything. at 20 you are allowed to be bad at things, you're allowed to make mistakes, and you're allowed to feel lost and confused. because at 20 you're still learning. you're trying to navigate a really difficult time where everyone expects you to be an adult but treats you like a child. you're surrounded by peers that are all trying to convince the world that they are adults that have their shit together. those a valid struggles, and on top of your rough teenage years, it makes sense that it'd hit you hard. i'm sorry that your parents aren't supportive. and about the way that people treated you. you didn't deserve that and i can tell you're not ready to give up. i'm proud of your for applying for jobs, and trying meds, and trying therapies, and even for posting here. those things can be so so hard to do when you're struggling and have no energy. you're worth more than your job or lack of. sometimes when you're just trying to survive, you don't have a lot of time to thrive. but this post alone makes it sound like you still have such an inner fight and are fighting your ass off too feel better, and i wish the people around you would recognise that.</data>

  <data key="d1">i just wanted to add when you try therapy or meds next time, your parents are not allowed to force you to quit. it is only your responsibility to see it you are progressing. it can be slow, it can be fast suddenly. you and your therapist, doctor have insight to say if there are any progress. even if you don't have a job and your parents are paying for therapy. normal human being acts in a human way. they have to support.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have a 23 year old daughter that completely wasted her first year in college. she didnt apply herself and and couldnt figure things out, even with counseling. i vented to a buddy about this and his best advise to me was to remember that life isnt a sprint, its a marathon. not everyone progresses at the same rate, but the end goal is what matters, not how long its taking you. ive since taken this approach when trying to understand my daughter. find some goals for you to achieve. they can be small and can be anything from getting better organized, getting fit, improving relationships with friends by inviting them to do things, taking classes to develop yourself, learning a hobby, etc. if you can get some small quick wins, then over time, they will become big wins. you just need those small wins to pump up your self confidence and motivation.</data>

  <data key="d1">a man stood on a cliff and looked over the ocean. what's out there, he thought to himself, and a little voice replied there's nothing, nothing out there. the man believed it, but wasn't entirely sure so he bought a boat, hired a crew and sailed out into the wide ocean. after a long journey, he discovered a new land full of strange new plants and animals, new cultures and more. and it was amazing the ocean wasn't empty after all. i know sometimes the future can look like there's nothing to live for. we all feel like that sometimes. it's easy to believe, especially with everything going on in the world. i but it's worth sticking around. believing is not the same as knowing. be that man. build that boat. let's find out together. live. who knows what your future holds. i have faith in you. here if you need a friend, always.</data>

  <data key="d1">don't apologize, this is a place to get your feeling out. however, have you considered moving? nyc is very busy and that can contribute to your stress and anxiety. however, you need to focus on getting a job that you feel happy at and enjoy working there, i'm sure there's jobs that wouldn't require too much communication with others, that could help with your social anxiety. i hope whatever you decide to do is better than the situation you're currently in. i'm so proud of you for still being here despite how difficult things are at the moment.</data>

  <data key="d1">that's a tough situation but you can't let your parents control your life, i know you don't want to disappoint them, but your mental health is declining due to this and it's not good in any way. you need to take care of yourself, you won't end up broke or poor as long as you're smart with your money. you deserve to be happy and even if that means making your parents a bit upset, they'll get over it. try communicating with them how this all is making you feel and maybe they'll understand a bit. and if not, just do what makes you happy and don't feel bad for it. this is your life, make decisions for yourself that you're happy with, not that your parents will be happy with.</data>

  <data key="d1">both my parents didnt make it educational wise. my father is an immigrant so hes really about the hussle mentality and education and stuff, he works as a construction worker. my mom is a home health aid and is laid off from work frm an accident and has a case. all she does all day is smoke weedcigarettes and at times with her boyfriend, plus sleep all day. and its like it doesnt make sense for you to keep pushing me through with this job case management if all you do is bullshit all dayur being a hypocrite. i know they both want me to succeed and be better off than them i love both of them. but i want to feel content within myself as well. i have interests of my own like acting, paintingsketching, makeup, helping others, and anything that has to do with the creative arts. but honestly i just want to know if theres a job where i dont have to be directly helping people. something laidback and chill possibly</data>

  <data key="d1">yeah i get that anxiety is awful and seeing people so on the brink can make you feel worse about life in general. when i have panicanxiety attacks i place a hand on a flat surface, palm first then fingers, it feels weirdly grounding and takes my mind off it for a sec. virtual hug if you'd like one i hope you feel better, i hope life goes well for you. you deserve it.</data>

  <data key="d1">reddit is a good source of information but not a reliable source of support. if you're a guy you'll virtually receive zero support, and if you're a girl then you're getting a different kind of attention that is usually borderline inappropriate. honestly, when suicidal, this is probably one of the worst places when seeking help.</data>

  <data key="d1">can you get medical attention? because if it keeps opening it might be a good idea if not try to use bandages to cover it and keep applying some preassure to it to stop the bleeding.</data>

  <data key="d1">you can use regular bandaids to help keep them closed. put them perpendicular to the injury with the edges of skin pushed together use a couple if you need to, it should help the wound start to close back up. make sure you've cleaned the wound first if it's still open. i've just taped paper towels on top before to avoid getting blood on my clothes, those usual pull off the scab when you take them off and make it start bleeding again though.</data>

  <data key="d1">there's no 'safe' way to kill yourself. basically everything carries extreme risk of permanent mutilation or brain damage then having to live that way. good news is you've posted in a great place to chat with some people who have had very similar thoughts, and hopefully it will bring you some peace to know that you're not alone and a lot of us know how you're feeling. sometimes just that feeling alone can be enough to get you through, hopefully it is 3</data>

  <data key="d1">i'd say it depends on how you feel. if you don't rely on it to keep going, get rid of it. there are lots of other ways to sh that are less bad for your body in the longterm. but, you know, take one step at a time. if you don't feel safe without the option to sh with it, give yourself some time.</data>

  <data key="d1">i think sometimes for people who havent experienced what youre going through it can be hard to understand why youd want to keep it. maybe try explaining that it has been the coping mechanism you are comfortable with and whilst you are in the interim trying to figure out a favourable way to cope it is like a comfort blanket to know that its there that doesnt guarantee youre going to use it though. its not always as simple as removing it as something which has sometimes been your only source of relief it could actually cause you unnecessary anxiety not having it there. i know, i know, its bad, i think wed all rather not have to use that to cope in an ideal world, but theres a verrrryyyy fine line to find between keeping yourself safe and keeping yourself sane. i think i would be comforted as your friend if you explained it with that rationale. i hope things start looking up for you soon.</data>

  <data key="d1">please dont go it angel if anything an overdose will just cause you either 1. a long nap, 2. to get very sick or 3. an excruciatingly slow, painful death as each organ fails. the human body is a resilient, tough motherfucker so its really not an easy way to go. even with just the right drugs it can take days at a time to actually die. just tell your boyfriend thats you struggle with these thoughts, like many do, independently of your relationship and he shouldnt ever feel that its his fault. explain you care for him deeply and that he does make you happy but this is just something youre going through in your own mind right now, like any other illness. even if all he can offer is some comfort and reassurance that may be all you need for now. and if not him then youll always have your family in your corner, no matter what.</data>

  <data key="d1">yes, it does happen that a depressive episode resolves itself. i am glad you pulled through it. but if someone has more episodes, it is also frequent that they will relapse. find a specialist, someone you can periodically talk to, and they can give you more information and if your mood goes dark again, catch it up at the beginning.</data>

  <data key="d1">sorry. i wasn't well when i commented. my comment was meant for a different post and a different person. don't know how i messed up this bad but i apologize. it was an accident. edit i don't have the reddit app available on my device and for some reason things sometimes get messed up through the browser version. i just noticed most of my comments and people's replies from last night aren't showing even worse than usual. obviously, i'm here and i'm struggling. in fact, i stood up for you and reported the person who said something really messed up to you on this post. that's probably part of the reason things got switched up. you're welcome, btw. this is what i always get when i stick my neck out and help people or try to.</data>

  <data key="d1">you can find or make a new family but you won't get a second chance at life. there are 7 billion humans and many more creatures like dogs and cats you can totally find someone who will understand you ,pick yourself up don't be like this. give your family some time maybe they will come around and if they don't, fuck them, you don't need them to live a happy life,think of them as a benign tumourthe kind thats not deadly so imagine you have a benign tumour in your stomach its not deadly but hinders your everyday life so the natural option would be to cut it off right so when your family is getting toxic cut the off you can totally find people who will love you unconditionally for who you are soo make your beautiful life worth living</data>

  <data key="d1">i can absolutely relate. my major is considered indemand. i completed undergrad and grad school at two great schools. yet, my resume kept getting rejected despite spending hundreds of dollars getting it professionally edited. at one point, it seemed as if i received rejection emails within hours of submitting an application. finally, i applied to a fellowship and ended up being hired as a fellow. it kind of sucks being at the bottom when your peers are all midlevel and seniorlevel. ive definitely become disillusioned through this entire journey. as a fellow, i am overworked and severely underpaid but i had no choice because i was drowning in credit card debt from being unemployed for so long. my depression has worsened recently. im not really happy with my job. what sucks is that there isnt a job guaranteed after my fellowship ends. im scared at the thought of being unemployed again. things got so bad that i started to have illogical thoughts about life. i started to believe still kind of believe to an extent that most of the workforce are robots and only hire fellow robots. they must know or sense that im not one of them and that is why they constantly reject my applications. i think this is depression and possibly psychosis talking though. sorry for ranting, its just that i really resonated with op. i wish i had more encouraging sentiments. i wish you the best of luck in finding a job.</data>

  <data key="d1">i saw your earlier post. you're going through an incredibly painful thing at your age. as you note, during the day you can distract yourself and it's worst at night when you're alone with your thoughts. that's standard. is there any way you can tire yourself out before you return home? you need to be as active as you can. you may want to try doing things that make you feel competent and useful. a lot of people find that helpful. unfortunately, the pain doesn't just disappear. it does take time. that being said, this too shall pass. many many people have sadly been in your place before and sadly many will in the future as well. it will suck for a bit but, the pain will fade with time. all the best, ike</data>

  <data key="d1">physical activity helps, and a lot. you can put on some headphones and go for a walk for half an hour, or an hour, you can also leave your resume in places where the work is physical, something like lifting and carrying boxes, that will give you a physical activity, and money. you would also interact with more people, and you may make friends.</data>

  <data key="d1">sad. physical activity helps a lot with depression, if you can try it even with your arms it will improve your life a lot. you have to keep your mind and body busy, read a book, play video games, watch series and movies, and add physical activity to all that. another important thing is to find a daily purpose, something simple like having a bed, cooking, reading this book, etc.</data>

  <data key="d1">in our experience, looking for reasons usually isn't very helpful. it's better to look for understanding and connection if we get that, the reasons, which are unique to every person, appear on their own. i know it might be frustrating that i've just said that you probably can't have what you feel like you desperately need. you probably can get it, but the way to get it is a little different than you might expect. when you say you've spent a third of your life like this, can you explain more about what you mean by that? and fwiw it's totally fair that you're sick of being told to keep going because your family will be sad. that just adds to your emotional burdens and it sounds like you're already carrying more than you can handled. i sure hope it's not your family who's telling you that.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey bub. sorry to hear youre struggling. youre not alone at all, sometimes worst fears and anxieties can drive us to try and hurt ourselves. bare in mind that you, under no circumstances deserve that and it might feel better for a split second before reality hits. you are precious and important, and if you are on the verge of causing yourself pain you need to reach out. sometimes family wont even take you seriously but the is a lot of online support and medical support you can look for. listen, i know its not easy and sometimes takes a long while, but once you make a change and keep at it for enough time you can see improvements much love to you</data>

  <data key="d1">when these urges hit would you be willing to try snapping a rubber band against your skin or maybe just hold a tight grip on some ice cubes until they melt instead? if youre willing and able to talk to a psych professional it may help you to rationalize and understand these moments. there may come a day when youll feel better, but the scars that knives can leave could possibly be enough to sort of drag you into a dark place again.</data>

  <data key="d1">i wish people would just stop with the you're selfish if you commit suicide thing, it's super unhelpful.if someone is having thoughts of suicide then making them feel worse about themselves is somehow going to make those thoughts go away like magic? the answer is clearly no.so what if you think it's selfish? even if it was, what's wrong with being selfish every now and then? that said, op, while i sympathize with your feeling i would encourage you to try reaching out to some of your friends. sometimes people are so wrapped up in their own lives they forget to check in on those they care aboutare waiting to be reached out to despite everyone being glued to their phones these days. i'm so sorry for your losses and understand how devastating it can be as i myself have had a similar experience this year, losing many loved ones within months of each other. it truly is the worst and what put the idea of suicide in my mind for the first time. you are not useless, you are not worthless and whatever you choose to do with your life is up to you alone. screw everyone who tells you different.</data>

  <data key="d1">that's horrible. do you think you can go talk to your school therapist or teacher? anyone you trust? you just need help, trust me i have adhd too so i know the struggle of getting assignments done on time and doing school work, you need help finding strategies to handle it. i know i am a random stranger on the internet that has no control of you or your life but i don't want you to die. you are far too young for this, to be able to feel such emotions as wanting to die. getting friends is hard, how about trying getting into some hobby at school? find people that like the same things as you? that's the best way to find friends. i wish i could help more but all i can do is give advice here on reddit, i hope this helps you and i wish you the best. i truly do even if you do not believe me</data>

  <data key="d1">the money will set them up for about 10 years. wife can remarry and find someone better. my kids know i love them. but they also know how many issues i have mentally and they watched me slowly change from the man i used to be to the one i am now. literally everyone in my house hates being around me at this point. and i'm just tired of hurting and all the thoughts going through my head. plus.... technically it won't be a suicide if someone else takes my life.</data>

  <data key="d1">you are not obligated to be happy. let yourself feel whatever you feel. grieve if you wish, be happy if you wish. also, don't worry about the 2 people you mentioned, their hatred is without any valid reason. even if none may praise you, that does not mean that you are not good, or that have not done good. the fact that you have kept on enduring speaks to your strength. i wish you the strength you will need to overcome the troubles you are facing. remember, if you need advice, or if you wish to speak further, then speak to us or others you place trust in.</data>

  <data key="d1">i feel the same, for a long time its been my biggest deterrent. over time its become less and less, but is still one of the main reasons that and fear of the voidnothingness. in part it feels selfish, but after being suicidal for over half my life 14 years, it sometimes feels selfish of everyone else to expect me to stay because it would be hard for them if i left. i dont know, its all fucked. we carry on. the most important step is the next one and all that.</data>

  <data key="d1">well, even though i'm a stranger to you, i do love you even as just another human being. so that guy is not right. you're stronger than he is. i'm so happy that you cried and let out your emotions instead of bottling it up. it's healthy that way, and gives you an outlet for your pain. you're beautiful. i can tell from the way you write and how you didn't lower yourself to his level and lose your temper at the store. i admire you, and in that manner, i love that about you. screw those people who say otherwise. they know nothing about you.</data>

  <data key="d1">i understand where you are coming from but dying isnt the way to go. sometimes, its all about being real in a fake world, all these annoying things and stresses, they may bother so much but it isnt real its all fake. they are a test and they are testing you. the only way to pass the test and beat the unseen enemy is to do as much good and positive things for others as you can to make people happy. if you think youll mess up, thats ok because you only had good intentions. try again and again and dont give up. you have to feed the homeless and poor and make folks happy and you have to love yourself because you are an amazing person. thats how you win the game and beat the enemies. their are jinn affecting you. they used people and circumstances to bring you down. dont let them.</data>

  <data key="d1">hey buddy. thats really some serious issues you have been dealing with, im sorry you went through that. noone should ever experience anything like that honestly, both rape and being bullied. yes other people are in bad situations too, and some have it even worse then you. but please dont think for a second that your issues are minute or not real. your pain is definitely real and it should be treated as such. hey. being cheerful and happy go lucky even tho you feel like shit is no easy task. you should pad yourself on the back and give yourself some credit for being so strong. i dont think you should talk to your friends about this, or to your parents about it either. i think you could get in touch with a good therapist and allow yourself to open up and tell your side of the story. such information has a tendency to make friends and family see you differently. but to be honest, what happened to you is absolutely not okay. at 10 years of age you have no proper comprehension of the world in which you are involved. what happened is criminal and should be see as such. you might not see mental health as real or believe in it, but i think it would do you very good to talk about it in a safe space, with a trained therapist. i wish you good luck friend. take care of yourself and be well.</data>

  <data key="d1">it's also a symptom of someone who had childhood trauma. alcoholic father, unstable codependent mother, no relationship with siblings. left to parent yourself. home life was not consistent. yep. it leads to ups and downs as an adult. healing the inner child is one of the ways to break out of the cycle. complex trauma therapy emdr, grounding, self awareness, etc. medication has a 5050 chance of making you artificially happy for a short period of time. working on the past is the only way forward</data>

  <data key="d1">i dont remember anything from my early childhood but all my symptoms in general seem to point to a history of trauma and possible parental neglect which doesnt come as a surprise to me, knowing my parents the only thing i do remember is that i always had these moments where i would start crying hysterically in reaction to something and actually start hyperventilating and literally gasping for air because i couldnt breathe and my parents never did anything about it or took me to see a doctor. not once. they would just ignore me and let it pass so to speak</data>

  <data key="d1">it sounds as though you remember more than you realize. panic attacks, abuse, neglect, being ignored. those are all terribly confusing for a child and even worse those emotions linger into adulthood, causing our nervous systems to be on guard all the time, always looking for threats. when a person has an unstable home life, this can lead to extreme reactions as an adult. we can go into fight where we are aggressive, flight where we run from everything, collapse where we just give up become suicidal and depressed and more. have toy seen anyone that specializes in trauma therapy?</data>

  <data key="d1">hi fren. the first thing i noticed was that you left the i out of your subject. intentional or ironic, but someone noticed. social media is the absolute last place you should look for support, most people are on their worshiping themselves. think of this as an opportunity to trim away the people who dont seem to notice you and replace them with ones who do. i know it sounds like a stupid cliche but its possible. dont let people beat you who arent even trying. lots of people dont make 24, you did, thats saying a lot in todays world. give one or some the chance to know you.</data>

  <data key="d1">i'm sorry no one reached out to your cries for help. i can see why you feel invisible and alone, but don't let that get you down. just because a select few ignore your presence doesn't mean everyone will. there's nothing wrong with you. don't wish to be someone else wish to be a better you. people would welcome you if they knew you well enough. you can try to find likeminded people who you can be yourself around. and you can eventually grow and learn from them, too. it might seem difficult, but it's not as hard as it sounds. you can find them through acquaintances or even online. it's not impossible. i hope this helps.</data>

  <data key="d1">i had a lovely ex that spent multiple years mentally and physically absuing me. then i finally left. then he continued to try and mentally fuck with me by threatening to kill himself knowing it would keep me around. please don't let him have that control over you. he's in full control of his actions and knows precisely what he's doing to try and manipulate you. please don't let him lure you back in with his empty threats.</data>

  <data key="d1">do you have any symptoms that make you feel like you have impacted your health? given your age i'm gonna assume you're fine and are probably overthinking. this is also a good thing in a way, you're so young and already concerned about the negative impact of drug use. hopefully this keeps you from any serious bad habits that would ruin your lifestyle and future as you get older. you're already being reflective and introspective about it all. i hope that the malaise lifts and you actually discovery you've got the world in front of you.</data>

  <data key="d1">i have a disney pass and go to disneyland 1x to 2x a month i would go more often but am already so dysfunctional that even the trips i do take there end uo being a tremendous ordeal for me. i enjoy my time there, but, to validate your feelings further, i do experience the parks through the lens of a suicidal person and often find myself feeling miserable there. i keep going, though, because i feel slightly less miserable there than when i'm elsewhere. but you're right. nothing seems to take away the pain... only slightly dull it for moments at a time. i'm sorry you're also struggling with this.</data>

  <data key="d1">from everything ive seen therapists have to disclose highrisk information to a third party. anything id have to say would definitely be highrisk to myself and so i feel like i just have no outlet to be open about how im actually feeling. i dont want to go to therapy and only talk about some things im going through</data>

  <data key="d1">i understand. if you decide to be open you want to be able to be open about as many things as you want. truth is, people rarely have it all. if we don't sacrifice anything we won't progress in life. this doesn't mean you have to talk to a therapist, but even the path of least resistance has its drawbacks and that's why it's matter of choosing what to sacrifice, if there's something to sacrifice to being with.</data>

  <data key="d1">the way your parents fought is not your fault. a lot of the time, parents will take things out on their kids because they know the kids cannot do anything. a lot of the jealousy and distancing you describe sounds like depression. wishing you could be better and therefore getting angry at others who are. distancing yourself because your parents made you feel like a burden. i promise you though, not everybody sees you that way just because your parents did, and a lot of people will appreciate yo you if you allow them to. i know its difficult but distancing yourself will not make the problems youre facing better and itll make you feel less and less worth something. as for your problems with anger and jealousy, those will take some introspection and maybe even some therapy if youre able but im sure anyone who cares about you will understand youre struggling and need time to figure yourself out if you just communicate properly with them. if not, they may see you as cold and rude.</data>
